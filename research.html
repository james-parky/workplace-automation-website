              One crude way to build a solution for our project may be to code
              it using a combination of HTML, Javascript, and CSS, whilst using
              an SQL database. However, this would be time consuming for such
              a complication project specification.
              <br><br>
              Luckily, a much easier and cleaner option was open to us. Our
              client for the project was Microsoft. As such, our project was
              particularly suited to using Microsoft products to increase the
              speed of our development.
              <br><br>
              After researching Microsoft development products, we decided to
              research Microsoft Power Apps. To do so, we both read through the
              <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/">official
                documentation</a>, and discussed this service at length with our
              clients representing Microsoft (Lee Stott, Ayca Bas), and a
              consultant representing the Ashton Court Group (Chris Seely), who
              acted as a mentor for us during this project.
              <br><br>
              Following these discussions and our research, it was determined that
              we would use the Microsoft Power Platform to develop our project.
              The reasons for this are as follows:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Dataverse Integration</strong> [1]
                  <br>
                  The Dataverse acts as a centralised location to store tables of
                  data. It is also designed to be integrated into Power Apps projects;
                  one may directly access the Dataverse through Power Apps. Data
                  may be easily retrieved, modified, deleted, or created, in the Dataverse
                  from Power Apps using <a href="#implementation">cloud flows</a>.
                  <br><br>
                  Through cloud flows, developers can also automate several interactions
                  with the data relevant to a certain project. This is useful for
                  many purposes within our project. For instance, within our project
                  it is expected that we may display a page of information about
                  supervisors to students. Using cloud flows, this page may be
                  updated whenever there is a new response.
                  <br><br>
                  Therefore, we predicted that the seamless integration between the Dataverse
                  and Power Apps would prove useful throughout our project, as almost
                  all of the requirements of our project concern the manipulation of data.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  <strong>Rapid Code Deployment</strong> [2]
                  <br>
                  One of the primary purposes of using Power Apps is for rapid
                  project development. Time would largely be the limiting factor
                  of the development of this project. Power Apps lends itself to
                  this purpose - if required, one can deploy a website with zero
                  code. While we will use code to perform more advanced functions,
                  using Power Apps we were able to create a host a website
                  <i>immediately</i>.
                  <br><br>
                  For instance, the Power Apps Canvas may be used to create
                  components quickly without needing to write any html, Power Automate
                  may be used to perform logical processes to data, and website
                  organisation is already set up, allowing one to tweak website
                  settings or structure at will.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  <strong>Multiple Platform Types</strong> [2]
                  <br>
                  For our app, we have three main user types, as detailed in the
                  requirements section. Each of these user types have different
                  needs and access levels. Within Power Apps, there are several
                  types of platform a developer may create, each with different
                  capabilities and use cases. Of these, there are three platforms
                  which may be suited to our project - <i>Canvas Apps, Portals, and
                    Model-Driven Apps.</i>
                  <br><br>
                  <u>Canvas Apps</u> [3]
                  <br>
                  A Canvas App is useful for creating a very simple space for
                  a user to view and interact with data. Canvas Apps are incredibly
                  quick to create - for instance, within a few clicks and zero lines
                  of code one may create a Canvas App to display a table imported from a
                  CSV file stored in the cloud. The drawback of a Canvas App is its
                  simplicity - a developer is not afforded much customisation, and fewer
                  opportunities are present for complex interaction between a users and the data.
                  <br><br>
                  <u>Portals</u> [4]
                  <br>
                  A Portal, like a Canvas App, allows a developer to create a
                  space for users to view and interact with data. However, a
                  Portal is useful for giving a user for complex ways to interact
                  with said data. For example, a developer has greater control over
                  the view and layout of a deployment, or for instance can enable
                  a developer to create more advanced forms for the user to fill out.
                  In a Portal, a user still remains somewhat limited in what they have
                  access to - a user is not naturally given permission and an easy way
                  to interact with data. Therefore, a Portal is great for a middle-ground,
                  when a user will need to make more complex interactions with the project,
                  but only requires limited access to the database and needs a straightforward
                  layout to perform a few specific procedures without being swamped with a
                  complicated page of information.
                  <br><br>
                  <u>Model-Driven Apps</u> [6]
                  <br>
                  A Model-Driven App affords the user with a high degree of visibility and
                  control over tables in the database. Through a PowerBI dashboard [7],
                  they may also see more complicated insights in the data, visualised. The
                  drawback to this is that a user may not always <i>need</i> such close interaction
                  with the database. Additionally, there is limited room to control the user
                  interface of a Model-Driven App - it has fewer options to be as attractive
                  and simple as a Portal or Canvas App. Therefore, it is suited to a situation
                  where the user needs a high degree of interaction with a large portion of the
                  database, and will be have some pre-requisite knowledge of how to navigate and
                  use it.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <br>
              To reflect on our user types; Firstly, we have an administrator who needs a large
              amount of control over the data stored in the solution and can be easily
              familiarised with the project. Secondly, students and professors - who need a
              high amount of controlled interaction with the data, but will not necessarily
              all be familiar with how to use the project.
              <br><br>
              As a result, it appears the
              appropriate platforms to build our project with would be a model-driven app for
              the administrator, and a portal for the students and academics.
              <br><br>

              <strong>Project Operations</strong> [5]
              <br>
              A Power Apps solution may be extended using
              Project Operations. As described in Microsoft
              Official Documentation, Project Operations can be used for "easy
              resource workload distribution" and "skillset matching to meet
              demands" [5]. This fits our requirements well, as we need to
              match the skillsets of students and academics as closely as
              possible to find the optimal project for both. This would eliminate
              the need to manually develop a matching algorithms ourselves -
              development would be significantly sped up as Project Operations would
              generate this algorithms for us
              <br><br>
              There are, however, drawbacks to using Project Operations. These are:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Limited Control</strong> - while a built in allocation
                  algorithm would speep up development, naturally there would be
                  a more limited amount of control in its implementation. For
                  instance, micro-parameters may not be available for a developer
                  to tweak, and a developer is not give so much control of the
                  algorithms itself which is used in allocation.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  <strong>Licence Fees</strong> - to use Project Operations, one
                  must pay a licence fee in addition to the Power Apps fee [8].
                  For a basic plan, this is £90.50 per user. If the matching
                  algorithm can be coded by hand, the amount of money saved would
                  be immense in the long run - especially when considering there
                  would likely be several users to pay for.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  <strong>Longevity</strong> - linked to the above point on limited control,
                  using Project Operations makes the matching algorithm entirely tied to and
                  reliant on Project Operations. The world of technology moves quickly, and
                  it is not unlikely that at some point in the future, Project Operations
                  could become obselete, or be changed in a way which affects our project.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  <strong>Project Specialisation</strong> - using an out-of-the-box algorithm
                  from Project Operations makes it more difficult to specialise and
                  optimise this algorithm to suit our project. For example, it is difficult
                  to specify if we would want to use an algorithm which prioritises the quality
                  of matches compared to one which prioritises making sure each academic has
                  at least one match.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Reproducibility</strong> - the Project Operations allocation algorithm
                  is reproducible in the sense that it is straightforward, and so the process for
                  using it in two different projects is simple. However, for projects with more
                  nuances, the stripped-down interaction with the algorithm means one will
                  struggle to apply more complicated aspects to similar projects. For instance,
                  take an example of a similar project such as allocating teaching assistants to
                  modules. If an allocation algorithm were manually coded, one could read the previous
                  for help, or code it in a more general way which allows the algorithm to be applied to
                  a range of things whilst maintaining the ability to cater to nuances. If Project
                  Operations is used, a developer would simply need to build the solution from
                  square one again, and may again struggle to deal with specific issues within a
                  particular project.
                </li>
              </ul>

              As a result of this analysis, we decided that it would be more beneficial
              to code the matching algorithm manually - our project is fairly specialised
              and so would suffer under the contraints of Project Operations using a general
              skills-based allocation algorithm with limited control. Secondly, given the
              number of users interacting with our project, the cost may become extremely
              high. Lastly, there are many situations within UCL where an automated allocation
              algorithm would be of great help. It would therefore be of great benefit to have a
              coded allocation algorithm which may be applied in a similar way to many projects.
