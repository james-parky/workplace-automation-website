                <p>We have asked 4 people who have not been involved with our project to test the FYP Portal for us. We
                    have developed 3 criteria against which to evaluate the success of our project: we are giving the
                    users a scenario where they are a student or a supervisor and asking them how they would approach
                    using the portal, we are asking them to evaluate the user interface for each page they visit, and
                    finally, we are sharing our MoSCoW requirements and asking if they believe each has been fulfilled.

                            <p>At the start of our project, we interviewed 4 students, 2 academics, and the
                                administrator who is
                                overseeing the FYP supervisor allocations this year.

                            <p>We decided to go with a semi-structured interview as the method of gathering information
                                from would
                                be users. We probed topics such as what they would like to be able to do with a new
                                system and
                                thoughts they had about the current system. We deemed this more appropriate than a
                                questionnaire as
                                people are more reluctant to be thorough and descriptive in questionnaires. We felt that
                                it was also
                                appropriate to ask open interview questions to really understand what the users want.

                                    was not anchored to the bottom of the page, making the page look less professional.

                            <p>Students and supervisors should only be able to submit a single Student Application or
                                Supervisor Application. Despite this, the form does not become unavailable to them after
                                they fill it out once. Ideally, it would disappear to stop them from accidentally
                                submitting another application, which would cause the “View Application” page to
                                malfunction. </p>

                                are implemented using subgrids rather than table fields. Therefore, they can not be made
