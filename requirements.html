          <strong>Project Background and Client Introduction</strong>
          <p>UCL’s Computer Science department has recently been transitioning several day-to-day activities in
            the form of business transformation as workflows. In partnership with Microsoft, several tools and
            systems have been requested across the teaching and learning domains. </p>
          <p>The highest burden faced by our client, Dean Mohamedally, is the Final Year Project Supervisor
            Allocation process which is being done manually. This involves finding a supervisor who would be good
            a match for each of 160 students in the class, which is a time-consuming process. </p>
            <strong>The Current Solution</strong>
            <p>The current solution is not fit for purpose and involves multiple stages of spreadsheets, conflicting
              requests, and lack of timelines. </p>
            <p>The process should allow a first-round survey to all final year students, to state their degree
              level, and whether they intend to do research only, industry only, or don’t know as their profile
              option. </p>
            <p>Visibility of projects is a key ask for the academics - this includes research projects listing, ACM
              classification keywords of the academics, and visibility of the industry projects lists once they are
              ready. A solution that enables staff workloads to be input is needed at this point as those academics
              that have capacity to supervise and are not taken by students for their research projects, should then
              automatically make themselves available for projects with industry. </p>
            <p>The second-round survey is the matching of the students to the research projects. This needs
              timeframes to be set up that mark key dates: when projects are advertised, when the projects are taken
              by a student, or if a student is in discussions with an academic for a project. Only once this is
              facilitated, it will be then signed off as allocated as FYP for Research Academic Projects. </p>
            <p>After that stage, or in parallel, for students that have said yes to wanting industry projects on the
              UCL IXN, they will fill in a separate second round survey, called the UCL Motivation Tracking Survey.
              This data then profiles capabilities and allows a Teaching and Learning member of the team to import
              the student grades for the IXN and Strategic Alliance Teams to begin sourcing appropriate projects in
              those quantities. </p>
            <p>By March this data is completed and those who said they did not know will be once again advertised to
              come forward to choose in a 3rd cycle of survey forms. </p>
            <p>Academics need a listing that enables them to see, at a glance, who they are supervising as final
              year projects are allocated. </p>

                  <p>At the start of our project, we interviewed 4 students, 2 academics, and the administrator who is

                  </p>
                  <p>We decided to go with a semi-structured interview as the method of gathering information from would
                    be users. We probed topics such as what they would like to be able to do with a new system and
                    thoughts they had about the current system. We deemed this more appropriate than a questionnaire as
                    people are more reluctant to be thorough and descriptive in questionnaires. We felt that it was also
                    appropriate to ask open interview questions to really understand what the users want. </p>

                                list of supervisors – it turned out it was on the systems engineering Moodle page. </p>
                            </li>

                                was used to list their ACM keywords, so I had to look up the code every time. I wish it
                                was easier to browse the list of supervisors. Also, my device had a glitch with the file
                                that listed all the ACM keywords, which made browsing more difficult. </p>

                                found some great students to supervise this way. The only issues I've ever had were with
                                students who were allocated to me by the administrator, because sometimes we had little in
                                common and I felt I couldn’t provide the best advice on their dissertations.</p>

                          <strong>What have been the greatest pain points in administrating this process?</strong>
                          <p>It can take a lot of time to read through students’ answers and the available staff and try
                            to match them such that everyone is happy. There are a lot of dimensions to consider, so this
                            can be quite a taxing task. There are also some students who don’t find a supervisor on their
                            own and then don’t fill the form in, so I have to chase them down. Sometimes there are also
                            students and academics who agreed to work together but didn’t tell us, and this causes
                            confusion and a lot of back and forth. On top of all of this, I need to orchestrate the entire
                            process, from preparing forms, to getting that data out in a readable format, to making sure
                            students and staff are on board and well informed. It’s generally a lot of work. </p>
                          <strong>What are you most looking forward to getting out of this project?</strong>
                          <p>I am excited to not have to spend as much time organizing each step and doing everything by
                            hand. It took a very long time to come up with a document for students' supervisor options. I
                            had to create a list, too, for them to see the ACM keywords. It took a very long time. If the
                            system can handle displaying the correct inputs and outputs of data for each staff and
                            student, that would already cut down on a big task. The automatic matching is very useful too
                            - I could free up time to spend it better dealing with outliers or special cases. I also think
                            this could be replicated and used in many other situations and potentially by other
                            institutions to solve similar problems. </p>
                          <strong>What functionalities do you see as essential?</strong>
                          <p>I want it to be possible for professors to agree with students to work together before doing
                            any automatic matching. Please also make sure the administrator knows of all such pairs made.
                            I want to use ACM keywords to implement the matches. Academics should be asked to select their
                            ACM keywords, and I also want it to be possible for students to select some ACM keywords they
                            want to be matched by. This is particularly for students interested in research. A page where
                            the students can just type a link and see all the available supervisor options would be great.
