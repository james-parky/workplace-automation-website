          Abstract
        </h3>
      </header>
      <p>Universities around the world have the annual task of allocating each of their final-year students a
        supervisor. Many of these universities, including UCL, still sift through large spreadsheets manually looking
        for matches between students and supervisors. UCL also did not have a standardized way to facilitate
        communication between prospective supervisors and students. </p>
      <p>We partnered with Microsoft to showcase how a problem like this one could be elegantly solved using their
        Dynamics 365 products. We built two web apps, one for the students and supervisors to interact with, and one
        with higher privileges for the administrator to oversee the process. We brought every stage of the project
        allocation process to one site: academics register to supervise students, students browse through these options
        to reach out to supervisors, students who haven't find a supervisor apply to be automatically allocated one, and
        matches are made based on common interests. Whereas these stages used to all happen through different mediums,
        everything has been brought to a single portal. </p>
      <p>We maintained close correspondence with the lead of our own Final Year Project module to get feedback on our
        progress and update our course of action. As someone who would be using our solution, his positive feedback and
        approval of our solution was convincing confirmation that we had produced a good outcome. </p>

                <p>UCL’s Computer Science department has recently been transitioning several day-to-day activities in
                  the form of business transformation as workflows. In partnership with Microsoft, several tools and
                  systems have been requested across the teaching and learning domains. </p>
                <p>The highest burden faced by our client, Dean Mohamedally, is the Final Year Project Supervisor
                  Allocation process which is being done manually. This involves finding a supervisor who would be good
                  a match for each of 160 students in the class, which is a time-consuming process. </p>

              <div class="accordion-body">
                <p>The current solution is not fit for purpose and involves multiple stages of spreadsheets, conflicting
                  requests, and lack of timelines. </p>
                <p>The process should allow a first-round survey to all final year students, to state their degree
                  level, and whether they intend to do research only, industry only, or don’t know as their profile
                  option. </p>
                <p>Visibility of projects is a key ask for the academics - this includes research projects listing, ACM
                  classification keywords of the academics, and visibility of the industry projects lists once they are
                  ready. A solution that enables staff workloads to be input is needed at this point as those academics
                  that have capacity to supervise and are not taken by students for their research projects, should then
                  automatically make themselves available for projects with industry. </p>
                <p>The second-round survey is the matching of the students to the research projects. This needs
                  timeframes to be set up that mark key dates: when projects are advertised, when the projects are taken
                  by a student, or if a student is in discussions with an academic for a project. Only once this is
                  facilitated, it will be then signed off as allocated as FYP for Research Academic Projects. </p>
                <p>After that stage, or in parallel, for students that have said yes to wanting industry projects on the
                  UCL IXN, they will fill in a separate second round survey, called the UCL Motivation Tracking Survey.
                  This data then profiles capabilities and allows a Teaching and Learning member of the team to import
                  the student grades for the IXN and Strategic Alliance Teams to begin sourcing appropriate projects in
                  those quantities. </p>
                <p>By March this data is completed and those who said they did not know will be once again advertised to
                  come forward to choose in a 3rd cycle of survey forms. </p>
                <p>Academics need a listing that enables them to see, at a glance, who they are supervising as final
                  year projects are allocated. </p>

                  thoughts they had about the current system. We deemed this more appropriate than a questionnaire as

                              list of supervisors – it turned out it was on the systems engineering Moodle page. </p>

                          <li>
                            <p>I had a difficult time reading through the list of available supervisor options. A code
                              was used to list their ACM keywords, so I had to look up the code every time. I wish it
                              was easier to browse the list of supervisors. Also, my device had a glitch with the file
                              that listed all the ACM keywords, which made browsing more difficult. </p>

                              supervisors. Despite the fact it was a bit long, I don’t have trouble with it. I have
                              found some great students to supervise this way. The only issues I've ever had were with
                              students who were allocated to me by the administrator, because sometimes we had little in
                              common and I felt I couldn’t provide the best advice on their dissertations.</p>

                        <strong>What have been the greatest pain points in administrating this process?</strong>
                        <p>It can take a lot of time to read through students’ answers and the available staff and try
                          to match them such that everyone is happy. There are a lot of dimensions to consider, so this
                          can be quite a taxing task. There are also some students who don’t find a supervisor on their
                          own and then don’t fill the form in, so I have to chase them down. Sometimes there are also
                          students and academics who agreed to work together but didn’t tell us, and this causes
                          confusion and a lot of back and forth. On top of all of this, I need to orchestrate the entire
                          process, from preparing forms, to getting that data out in a readable format, to making sure
                          students and staff are on board and well informed. It’s generally a lot of work. </p>
                        <strong>What are you most looking forward to getting out of this project?</strong>
                        <p>I am excited to not have to spend as much time organizing each step and doing everything by
                          hand. It took a very long time to come up with a document for students' supervisor options. I
                          had to create a list, too, for them to see the ACM keywords. It took a very long time. If the
                          system can handle displaying the correct inputs and outputs of data for each staff and
                          student, that would already cut down on a big task. The automatic matching is very useful too
                          - I could free up time to spend it better dealing with outliers or special cases. I also think
                          this could be replicated and used in many other situations and potentially by other
                          institutions to solve similar problems. </p>
                        <strong>What functionalities do you see as essential?</strong>
                        <p>I want it to be possible for professors to agree with students to work together before doing
                          any automatic matching. Please also make sure the administrator knows of all such pairs made.
                          I want to use ACM keywords to implement the matches. Academics should be asked to select their
                          ACM keywords, and I also want it to be possible for students to select some ACM keywords they
                          want to be matched by. This is particularly for students interested in research. A page where
                          the students can just type a link and see all the available supervisor options would be great.

                One crude way to build a solution for our project may be to code
                it using a combination of HTML, Javascript, and CSS, whilst using
                an SQL database. However, this would be time consuming for such
                a complication project specification.
                <br><br>
                Luckily, a much easier and cleaner option was open to us. Our
                client for the project was Microsoft. As such, our project was
                particularly suited to using Microsoft products to increase the
                speed of our development.
                <br><br>
                After researching Microsoft development products, we decided to
                research Microsoft Power Apps. To do so, we both read through the
                <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/">official
                  documentation</a>, and discussed this service at length with our
                clients representing Microsoft (Lee Stott, Ayca Bas), and a
                consultant representing the Ashton Court Group (Chris Seely), who
                acted as a mentor for us during this project.
                <br><br>
                Following these discussions and our research, it was determined that
                we would use the Microsoft Power Platform to develop our project.
                The reasons for this are as follows:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Dataverse Integration</strong> [1]
                    <br>
                    The Dataverse acts as a centralised location to store tables of
                    data. It is also designed to be integrated into Power Apps projects;
                    one may directly access the Dataverse through Power Apps. Data
                    may be easily retrieved, modified, deleted, or created, in the Dataverse
                    from Power Apps using <a href="#implementation">cloud flows</a>.
                    <br><br>
                    Through cloud flows, developers can also automate several interactions
                    with the data relevant to a certain project. This is useful for
                    many purposes within our project. For instance, within our project
                    it is expected that we may display a page of information about
                    supervisors to students. Using cloud flows, this page may be
                    updated whenever there is a new response.
                    <br><br>
                    Therefore, we predicted that the seamless integration between the Dataverse
                    and Power Apps would prove useful throughout our project, as almost
                    all of the requirements of our project concern the manipulation of data.
                  </li>
                  <br>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Rapid Code Deployment</strong> [2]
                    <br>
                    One of the primary purposes of using Power Apps is for rapid
                    project development. Time would largely be the limiting factor
                    of the development of this project. Power Apps lends itself to
                    this purpose - if required, one can deploy a website with zero
                    code. While we will use code to perform more advanced functions,
                    using Power Apps we were able to create a host a website
                    <i>immediately</i>.
                    <br><br>
                    For instance, the Power Apps Canvas may be used to create
                    components quickly without needing to write any html, Power Automate
                    may be used to perform logical processes to data, and website
                    organisation is already set up, allowing one to tweak website
                    settings or structure at will.
                  </li>
                  <br>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Multiple Platform Types</strong> [2]
                    <br>
                    For our app, we have three main user types, as detailed in the
                    requirements section. Each of these user types have different
                    needs and access levels. Within Power Apps, there are several
                    types of platform a developer may create, each with different
                    capabilities and use cases. Of these, there are three platforms
                    which may be suited to our project - <i>Canvas Apps, Portals, and
                      Model-Driven Apps.</i>
                    <br><br>
                    <u>Canvas Apps</u> [3]
                    <br>
                    A Canvas App is useful for creating a very simple space for
                    a user to view and interact with data. Canvas Apps are incredibly
                    quick to create - for instance, within a few clicks and zero lines
                    of code one may create a Canvas App to display a table imported from a
                    CSV file stored in the cloud. The drawback of a Canvas App is its
                    simplicity - a developer is not afforded much customisation, and fewer
                    opportunities are present for complex interaction between a users and the data.
                    <br><br>
                    <u>Portals</u> [4]
                    <br>
                    A Portal, like a Canvas App, allows a developer to create a
                    space for users to view and interact with data. However, a
                    Portal is useful for giving a user for complex ways to interact
                    with said data. For example, a developer has greater control over
                    the view and layout of a deployment, or for instance can enable
                    a developer to create more advanced forms for the user to fill out.
                    In a Portal, a user still remains somewhat limited in what they have
                    access to - a user is not naturally given permission and an easy way
                    to interact with data. Therefore, a Portal is great for a middle-ground,
                    when a user will need to make more complex interactions with the project,
                    but only requires limited access to the database and needs a straightforward
                    layout to perform a few specific procedures without being swamped with a
                    complicated page of information.
                    <br><br>
                    <u>Model-Driven Apps</u> [6]
                    <br>
                    A Model-Driven App affords the user with a high degree of visibility and
                    control over tables in the database. Through a PowerBI dashboard [7],
                    they may also see more complicated insights in the data, visualised. The
                    drawback to this is that a user may not always <i>need</i> such close interaction
                    with the database. Additionally, there is limited room to control the user
                    interface of a Model-Driven App - it has fewer options to be as attractive
                    and simple as a Portal or Canvas App. Therefore, it is suited to a situation
                    where the user needs a high degree of interaction with a large portion of the
                    database, and will be have some pre-requisite knowledge of how to navigate and
                    use it.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <br>
                To reflect on our user types; Firstly, we have an administrator who needs a large
                amount of control over the data stored in the solution and can be easily
                familiarised with the project. Secondly, students and professors - who need a
                high amount of controlled interaction with the data, but will not necessarily
                all be familiar with how to use the project.
                <br><br>
                As a result, it appears the
                appropriate platforms to build our project with would be a model-driven app for
                the administrator, and a portal for the students and academics.
                <br><br>

                <strong>Project Operations</strong> [5]
                <br>
                A Power Apps solution may be extended using
                Project Operations. As described in Microsoft
                Official Documentation, Project Operations can be used for "easy
                resource workload distribution" and "skillset matching to meet
                demands" [5]. This fits our requirements well, as we need to
                match the skillsets of students and academics as closely as
                possible to find the optimal project for both. This would eliminate
                the need to manually develop a matching algorithms ourselves -
                development would be significantly sped up as Project Operations would
                generate this algorithms for us
                <br><br>
                There are, however, drawbacks to using Project Operations. These are:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Limited Control</strong> - while a built in allocation
                    algorithm would speep up development, naturally there would be
                    a more limited amount of control in its implementation. For
                    instance, micro-parameters may not be available for a developer
                    to tweak, and a developer is not give so much control of the
                    algorithms itself which is used in allocation.
                  </li>
                  <br>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Licence Fees</strong> - to use Project Operations, one
                    must pay a licence fee in addition to the Power Apps fee [8].
                    For a basic plan, this is £90.50 per user. If the matching
                    algorithm can be coded by hand, the amount of money saved would
                    be immense in the long run - especially when considering there
                    would likely be several users to pay for.
                  </li>
                  <br>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Longevity</strong> - linked to the above point on limited control,
                    using Project Operations makes the matching algorithm entirely tied to and
                    reliant on Project Operations. The world of technology moves quickly, and
                    it is not unlikely that at some point in the future, Project Operations
                    could become obselete, or be changed in a way which affects our project.
                  </li>
                  <br>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Project Specialisation</strong> - using an out-of-the-box algorithm
                    from Project Operations makes it more difficult to specialise and
                    optimise this algorithm to suit our project. For example, it is difficult
                    to specify if we would want to use an algorithm which prioritises the quality
                    of matches compared to one which prioritises making sure each academic has
                    at least one match.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Reproducibility</strong> - the Project Operations allocation algorithm
                    is reproducible in the sense that it is straightforward, and so the process for
                    using it in two different projects is simple. However, for projects with more
                    nuances, the stripped-down interaction with the algorithm means one will
                    struggle to apply more complicated aspects to similar projects. For instance,
                    take an example of a similar project such as allocating teaching assistants to
                    modules. If an allocation algorithm were manually coded, one could read the previous
                    for help, or code it in a more general way which allows the algorithm to be applied to
                    a range of things whilst maintaining the ability to cater to nuances. If Project
                    Operations is used, a developer would simply need to build the solution from
                    square one again, and may again struggle to deal with specific issues within a
                    particular project.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                As a result of this analysis, we decided that it would be more beneficial
                to code the matching algorithm manually - our project is fairly specialised
                and so would suffer under the contraints of Project Operations using a general
                skills-based allocation algorithm with limited control. Secondly, given the
                number of users interacting with our project, the cost may become extremely
                high. Lastly, there are many situations within UCL where an automated allocation
                algorithm would be of great help. It would therefore be of great benefit to have a
                coded allocation algorithm which may be applied in a similar way to many projects.

              <p>The heart of this project is Power Apps, through which we did most of our development. It dynamically
                generates the Portal and Model-Driven App using Liquid to populate the Portal. The Portal is populated
                with data stored in Dataverse, which Power Apps communicates with and provides an interface for
                development (directly in Power Apps or through the Model-Driven App). Power Apps also integrates Power
                Automate to perform logical operations on Dataverse data based on triggers from the Portal interface
                (e.g., form submission, which is interpreted as a record addition). Power Apps also supports custom
                JavaScript code for additional custom functionality, which we used to implement automatic matching
                functionalities. The logistical aspects of each of these functionalities (aside from the custom
                JavaScript) is taken care of by Power Apps. </p>

                <p>Web Roles are very important to our solution as they dictate what any given user can and can't see/do
                  on our portal. There are three roles available to a user - Student, Supervisor, and Administrator.
                  Administrator roles should be assigned by the department using the Portal Management section of our
                  solution. The other two roles, Student and Supervisor are chosen by the user when they log in for the
                  first time.</p>
                <p>When a user first signs in on the portal's landing page, they are presented with this screen. After
                  using the radio buttons and submission button to select their role, they are taken to their chosen
                  role's respective home page. They will not have another opportunity to change this and must instead
                  ask an administrator to change it for them.</p>
                <img src="assets/img/implementation/web-roles/button.png" alt="">
                <p>After clicking the above button, the following code will run, triggering the flow that will assign
                  the correct web role to the current user based on which radio button they selected.</p>
                <img src="assets/img/implementation/web-roles/role_selection.png" alt="">
                <p>After a user has selected their role, whenever they next sign in, they do not see this role selected
                  screen and are instead directed to their home page, as mentioned before. This is the code that does
                  so.</p>
                <img src="assets/img/implementation/web-roles/redirect.png" alt="">
                <p>These roles are used to stop a user from seeing content that they should not be able to. Similar to
                  the above code, liquid is used on each of our Portal's web pages to check what roles are assigned to
                  the current users contact. If they do not have sufficient roles, they are prompted to return to the
                  sign in page.</p>

                  Flows are pieces of logic which allow some level of automation to otherwise static objects, such as
                  tables. Flows can be triggered by
                  several things, like the manual press of a button, the modification of a particular table, or the
                  arrival of a certain time of day.
                  They can be used to do things like edit data in a table or send an email. Below are some of the most
                  important ways in which we used
                  flows:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Add Contact Field to Supervisor ACM</strong>
                    <p>
                      This flow is triggered by the addition/modification/deletion of a record inside Supervisor
                      Responses
                      v2. When a Supervisor Application is submitted/modified/deleted, a record is created inside
                      Supervisor-ACM and the ID, ACM Keyword, and Supervisor Response ID fields are populated in that
                      record. This flow is used to populate the remaining Contact field of this new record. The flow
                      does
                      this by extracting the Contact field from the newly modified Supervisor Response record and
                      inserting it into the Supervisor-ACM records belonging to that supervisor.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Create Student-ACM Record</strong>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                      This flow is triggered by the addition/modification/deletion of a record inside Student Responses.
                      When a Student Application is submitted/modified/deleted, a record is created inside Student
                      Responses. We also want to create records inside Student-ACM, populating the columns ACM Keyword
                      and
                      Contact. The First-choice Interest field is extracted from the submitted record, and this is
                      mapped
                      to ACM Keywords using the Topic-ACM Maps. A record is created for the student associating them
                      with
                      each of these ACM keywords.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Insert Topic-ACM Records</strong>
                    <p>
                      This flow is triggered manually, and was created for the purpose of efficiently populating the
                      lookup table which maps student topics to ACM keywords. It works by extracting all ACM keywords
                      pertaining to a certain section and creating a row in the lookup table mapping the keyword to a
                      particular student topic. For example, it may select all ACM keywords beginning with '2.1', and
                      create a record mapping them to 'Algorithms and CS Core Theory'.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Assign Web Role to Contact</strong>
                    <p>This flow is triggered when a user signs in on the Portal for the first time and selects a role.
                      The flow is expecting a request with a JSON payload of a specific shape. This payload contains the
                      id of the currently signed-in user, along with the id of the web role that they just selected. The
                      flow then relates the record of the currently signed-in user in the Contact table with the record
                      of the selected web role in the Web Roles Table. Doing this gives the permissions of that web role
                      to the user.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Update Student Responses Availability</strong>
                    <p>This is the longest and most complex flow in the solution and is triggered by the
                      addition/modification of record inside the Supervisor-Student Pairs table. When a pair record is
                      added or editted in this table, there are two things that may happen depending on the value of the
                      'Approved' field in the record in focus.</p>
                    <p>If this has a value of 'Rejected,' meaning the supervisor didn't approve the match, the student
                      response of that match has it's 'Availability' field set to 'Yes.' Then, if the matches supervisor
                      has a remaining capacity less than the actual capacity, the supervior's 'Availability' is set to
                      'Yes' as well.</p>
                    <p>If instead the value is 'Approved,' if the matches supervisor's remaining capacity is equal to 0,
                      meaning they cannot facilitate any more students, the supervior's 'Availability' is set to 'No,'
                      while the student's is 'Yes.' The pair's 'Approved' field is also set to 'Rejected.' If instead
                      the supervisors remaining capacity is not equal to 0, it is decreased by 1, and the student's
                      'Availability' is set to 'No.'</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Post Match Data to Supervisor-Student Pairs Table</strong>
                    <p>This flow is triggered when a http POST request is sent to a specific API, with a payload
                      containing JSON data in a particular format. When the API receives this POST request, the flow
                      begins and extracts the JSON from the payload. This JSON data is the output of the matching
                      algorithm. It contains a list of supervisors, each with a list of students that they matched with
                      and the reason for the match (common ACM keyword). These are each extracted by the flow and
                      inserted into the 'Supervisor-Student Pairs' table. From the JSON data, the supervisorResponseIds
                      and studentResponseIds are used to get the name of the user that submitted the response. This is
                      what is entered into the table, rather than the responseId iteself. Each inputted pair is also
                      given a default 'Approved' field value of
                      'Pending' which can later be edited by the administrator.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li style="list-style: none;"><strong>HTTP Get Flows</strong>
                    <p>These 5 flows all work in the exact same way and exist for the same purpose - to extract data
                      from our database into the JavaScript code that is powering the matching algorithm process. These
                      flows are all triggered when a the flow's API receives an http GET request. This is a plain
                      request with no payload. Each flow will then send back the appropriate data from the correct
                      table. Not all fields are of use to the matching algorithm, so only a select few are sent back to
                      the JavaScript in the http response. The table that has it's data pulled is described in each
                      flow's title. These flows could be combined into one huge flow and all the data could be sent in
                      one response, however this would be a staggering amount of data, making the response not readable
                      at all to humans that need to possibly debug the code in the future. Seperating them also makes
                      the JavaScript code more orthogonal as the functions are not doing more than one task.</p>

                  Forms belong to tables. To create a form with X number of fields, you must first create a table with
                  the
                  same matching X number of columns. The data collected by filling out this form is stored in this table
                  in the respective columns. There are 2 main Insert forms used by the portal:

                  <li>

                    <br>
                    This can be found in PowerApps inside Supervisor Responses v2 (table) > Supervisor Responses v2 main
                    form. It should be accessed this way to customize the fields that appear on the form (and each
                    individual tab). It can be further customized through Portal Management > Advanced Forms >
                    Supervisor
                    Application. Here, it is possible to reorder the steps of the form and manage form Sessions. To
                    configure subgrids on this form, you should go to Portal Management > Basic Forms > Supervisor
                    Application v2 > Related > Advanced Form Metadata. It may be confusing that there is both a Basic
                    Form
                    and an Advanced Form for the supervisor application, however they are both linked to the Supervisor
                    Responses v2 main form (under the Supervisor Responses v2 table), so they work in harmony.

                    <strong>View Student Application</strong>
                    <p>This basic form is an edit form. This allows students who have already submitted an application
                      to view and edit their application. The ability to edit their application is entirely at the
                      discretion of the administrator, who may want to limit this capability. If so, the administrator
                      must visit Portal Management > Basic Forms > View Student Application and set the Mode to
                      ReadOnly. Then the administrator should also edit the app by going to Power Apps > Apps > FYP >
                      View Student Application page. Select the form on the page and change the mode to ReadOnly in the
                      right-hand menu bar. </p>

                  <li>
                    <strong>View Supervisor Application</strong>
                    <p>This basic form is an edit form. This allows supervisors who have already submitted an
                      application to view and edit their application. The ability to edit their application is entirely
                      at the discretion of the administrator, who may want to limit this capability. If so, the

                    <strong>Submit Supervisor-Student Pair</strong>
                    <p>This is an insert form. Once a supervisor agrees verbally with a student to supervise them, they
                      are required to fill out this form to report to the administration who they will be supervising
                      and optionally provide a project title and description. </p>

                    <strong>View Supervisee Responses</strong>
                    <p>This basic form is a ReadOnly form. Once supervisors has submitted notice they will be
                      supervising a specific student (basic form 3, above) they will be able to view their responses
                      through this form. They cannot edit their response, but they can delete form submissions and add
                      more submissions. </p>

                  <li>
                    <strong>Supervisor-ACM for subgrid</strong>
                    <p>This is a basic form used for selecting ACM Keywords through a subgrid (reference Custom N:N
                      relationships). The subgrid “create” button (which appears as “Add ACM Keyword”) calls this form
                      and ACM Keywords are added one-by-one through it. </p>
                  </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                  If you want to manually add a record to a table, you go to the
                  Table Name > Data > Add record. This opens a new tab and shows
                  the default Information (main) form, which is simplistic by
                  default and may only show 2 fields. To alter this and allow more
                  fields to be populated this way, edit the Information form
                  (of type Main, as opposed to Card or QuickViewForm). If you have
                  multiple main forms, the pop-up tab may open in either of the
                  main forms. You can select which main form you want to fill out
                  using the drop down menu on the form tab. Advanced forms can
                  support multiple steps, branching (I.e. conditional steps), and

                  Liquid is a template language, written amongst HTML that uses a combination of objects, tags, and
                  filters inside template files to display dynamic content. Liquid, like any template language, creates
                  a
                  bridge between an HTML file and a data store — in our context, the data we use for matching.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Liquid can be learnt fairly quickly using the <a
                    href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/">official documentation</a>.
                  Here are some examples where we used Liquid in our project:
                </p>

                  <u>Hiding Sensitive Data During Development</u>
                  <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                    <li>At times during our development, we needed to display data that should be available to
                      authenticated users <strong>only</strong>.
                      To do this, we used Liquid <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/tags/control-flow/">control
                        flow</a> tags to show or hide data
                      based on this condition:
                    </li>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>{% <span style="color: #1BB1DC">if user</span> %}</strong></li>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>{% <span style="color: #1BB1DC;">include 'my_page'</span>
                        %}</strong></li>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>{% <span style="color: #1BB1DC;">endif</span> %}</strong></li>
                    <br>
                    <li>If the user is not signed in, <strong>'user'</strong> will not exist, meaning the variable holds
                      a
                      value
                      of <strong>'Nil'</strong>. This means the <strong>'user'</strong> variable is
                      <strong>'falsy'</strong>, causing the condition to be
                      evaluated as <strong>false</strong> and therefore not display <strong>my_page</strong>.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>It should be noted that this is <strong>not</strong> the most sound and elegant solution to hide
                      content from the unauthorised.
                      PowerApps offers mechanisms to acheive this through <a href="#documentation-web_roles">Web
                        Roles</a>.</li>

                  <u>Displaying User-Specific Information</u>
                  <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                    <li>It's often useful to have a webpage display different content depending on who the user is, and
                      what information we have about them.
                      Objects may have certain attributes which can be used to acheive this. As a simple example, we
                      used:
                    </li>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>{{ <span style="color: #1BB1DC;">user.fullname</span> }}</strong></li>
                    <li>to display a header which display the correct name for the user that's currently logged in.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <br>
                  <u>Iteration to Display Elements in an Array</u>
                  <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                    <li>Under different conditions, different content may need to be included in the header. We used
                      Liquid to display all headings which
                      should be displayed within a given Web Link Set. Here is a heavily simplified method with which we
                      did this:
                    </li>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>{% <span style="color: #1BB1DC;">for link in primary_nav.sublinks</span>
                        %}</strong></li>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>{% <span style="color: #1BB1DC;">unless forloop.first</span>
                        %}</strong></li>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&lt;div
                        style="vertical-divider"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</strong></li>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>{% <span style="color: #1BB1DC;">endunless</span> %}</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>{{ <span style="color: #1BB1DC;">link.name</span> }}</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>{% <span style="color: #1BB1DC;">endfor</span> %}</strong></li>
                  </ul>

                <p>We had initially decided to use Project Operations for the supervised matching section of our
                  solution. However, after closer inspection of how the matching works in Project Operations, we decided
                  that we wouldn’t have enough control over how students were matched to supervisors. Instead, we
                  created a custom algorithm using Javascript.</p>

                <p>Our matching process can be split into 5 main, distinct components. </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Collection of Data</strong>
                    <p>Since our code is written in pure JavaScript, the required data is pulled from our solution’s
                      database using simple http GET requests. There are 5 different requests, that pull 5 separate sets
                      of data. This data is initially collected using PowerAutomate instant cloud flows (As seen above).
                      The flow can be broken down into three steps.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="matchgin__flow-steps" style="list-style: none;">
                      <li style="display:inline-block">
                        <img src="assets/img/implementation/matching/http_get.png" alt="">
                        <p>
                          As you can see by this image, the flow is waiting for a GET request to its specified API. Upon
                          receiving this request. Since the request doesnt need to send any data initially, the payload
                          format is left empyty. </p>
                      </li>
                      <li style="display:inline-block">
                        <img src="assets/img/implementation/matching/list_rows.png" alt="">
                        <p>Next, the flow performs a ‘list rows’ operation on the specified table to get all of
                          the lists into a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. Only the rows containing data
                          necessary
                          for matching are included to reduce the size of the payload sent back to our code. In this
                          case, the rows: 'acmclassificationcodesid', 'keyword', and 'id' are pulled from the 'ACM
                          Classification Codes' table.</p>
                      </li>

                        <p>Finally, an http request
                          of code 200 is sent back, including the JSON formatted list of data. This procedure is
                          repeated 5 times, once for each different table that we require data from.</p>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Cleaning the Received Data</strong>
                    <p>When the data for each table is received by the code, it needs to be cleaned and put into a named
                      JavaScript object, so that it can be easily accessed by the algorithm.
                      Here is an example of the aforementioned get requests. The data is initially fetched from the API
                      of the flow pulling data from the desired table. The data is then parsed into a new JavaScript
                      object, with more human-readble attribute names.
                      Data is also 'cleaned' where it needs to be. For example, in this function, we remove any records
                      that do not have a specified 'responseId.'
                    </p>
                    <img src="assets/img/implementation/matching/code/get_request.png" alt="">
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Parsing of the Data</strong>
                    <p>The received student data and supervisor data is then parsed into a more usable format. This is
                      done for multiple reasons. Firstly, when a student fills out a response form, they choose which
                      rough topics they have interests in. Each one of these topics relate to hundreds of ACM keywords.
                      Therefore the ACM keywords need to be collated into one student response object.
                      Secondly, when a supervisor fills out a response form, a news Supervisor-ACM table record is
                      generated for each ACM keyword they selected as relevant to them. To make matching more simple,
                      these too are collated so that there is only one supervisor response object per unique supervisor,
                      having many ACM keywords related to it.
                    </p>
                    <p>The below example shows the supervisor response parsing function. It can be seen that when
                      sorting through Supervisor-ACM table records, responses that have a responseId that has already
                      been used, have their ACM keywords appended to the already exisiting object, rather than creating
                      a new one.</p>
                    <img src="assets/img/implementation/matching/code/supervisor_parse.png" alt="">
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Finding All Possible Matches</strong>
                    <p>The next process is to find all possible students matched to each supervisor. These matches are
                      found based on whether the supervisor and student share an common ACM keyword in their responses.
                      If a student is found to match to a supervisor, the student's response object is inserted into an
                      array
                      of 'matched students' for the supervisor. This also contains the ACM keyword that they matched on,
                      and the priority that the student assigned to it.
                      This process is repeated for all students for all supervisors.</p>
                    <p>Below is the actual code for finding matches. It simply loops through each parsed supervisor
                      response object (formed in the previous step) and calls the findMatchingStudents function.
                      The findMatchingStudents function then loops through each parsed student response object and sees
                      if the response contains an ACM keyword that is also present in the current supervisor resposne
                      object.
                      If so, the student object is added to the supervisors list of matched students, as described
                      above.
                      The list of matches to that sueprvisor is returned.
                      This is repeated for every supervisor.
                    </p>
                    <img src="assets/img/implementation/matching/code/find_matching_students.png" alt="">

                  <li>
                    <strong>Ordering</strong>
                    <p>Then, for each supervisor, the matches are ordered based on the priority that the student
                      assigned
                      to the ACM keyword that they matched with the supervisor on.</p>
                    <img src="assets/img/implementation/matching/code/ordering.png" alt="">
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Reviewing the Matches</strong>
                    <p>The final stage of the code for the matching process, is the matches review. For each supervisor,
                      the matches that were found are reviewed one by one. Using the total number of unique student
                      responses and supervisor responses, a minimum number of matches per supervsior is calculated. Each
                      professor then has that many of their students matches 'finalised' and inserted into a final
                      matches
                      array. This is why the student matches list was orderd for each professor in the previous step.
                    </p>
                    <p>This section of code also creates a list of any supervisors that were left with no students
                      matched
                      to them at the end of this process. This should only ever happend because there were more
                      supervisors than students, not because there were no students interesting in doing what the
                      supervisor was willing to supervise - although that is still theoretically possible.</p>
                    <img src="assets/img/implementation/matching/code/review.png" alt="">
                    <p>In a similar way, this piece of code finds any students that could't be matched to any of the
                      supervisors. Again, in practice this will probably never happen since the topics that student
                      choose
                      as interests in their response encompass a vast amount of ACM keywords. However, since it is still
                      techinally possible, it is handled, since it would be usefull to the administrator. </p>

                    <strong>Sending the Matches Back to Our Solution</strong>
                    <p>After all of the matches between students and superviors have been reviewed, and matchless
                      supervisors and students have been found, the data is properly formatted and sent back to our
                      solution's database using an http POST request. </p>

                    <p>There is another flow in our solution waiting for
                      a POST request to a specific API, expecting a payload containing a specifically shapped JSON.</p>
                    <img src="assets/img/implementation/matching/post_request.png" alt="">
                    <p>The flow then iterates through the payload to extract all 'pairs' between a supervisor and
                      student. From each pair, it takes the studentResponseId and supervisorResponseId associated with
                      the pair. It uses these ID's to get the contacts of the people that submitted the responses.</p>

                <p>The above mentioned 'Matching Algorithm' is the backend logic for what happens during the matching
                  process, but how is it actually triggered?</p>
                <p>The administrator has sole access to a page on our portal wesbite from where the supervised matching
                  process can be initiated. The administrator is presented with instructions on how to use the page,
                  is given a button to click, and a label displays the current status of the algorithm. This is shown
                  below.</p>
                <img src="assets/img/implementation/matching/matching_page_initial.png" alt="">
                <p>After the administrator clicks the button and the above described matching algorithm has taken place,
                  the status label is updated, as seen below.
                </p>
                <img src="assets/img/implementation/matching/matching_page_status_completed.png" alt="">
                <p>As described in the above section, the results from the matching algorithm are inputted into the
                  'Supervisor-Student Pairs' table, which is viewable by the administrator. Here the matches can be
                  reviewed and then approved or rejected. When a pair record is editted as shown below, a PowerAutomate
                  instant flow is run, which performs the following logic.</p>
                <img src="assets/img/implementation/matching/edit_status_of_pair.png" alt="">
                <p>
                  If a pair is rejected by an administrator, the involved student's availability is set to 'Yes' and if
                  the supervisor's remaining capacity is less than their total capacity, the supervisor's availability
                  is also set to 'Yes.'
                </p>
                <p>
                  If a pair is instead accpeted by an administrator, if the supervior's remaining capacity is equal to
                  0, the student's availability is set to 'Yes,' the supervisor's availability is set to 'No' and the
                  pairs status is set to 'Rejected.' Otheriwise, the students availability is set to 'No' and the
                  supervisor's remaining capacity is reduced by 1.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The administrator should review matches and rerun the algorithm
                  until they are completely satisfied with the outcome.

                <h5><i>1:N, N:1, and N:N Relationships</i></h5>
                In PowerApps, a N:1 relationship is called a Lookup. A 1:N relationship is simply a reversed Lookup
                (lookup from the
                other table into this one). Creating either of these will create a column in the table that holds the
                lookup, and you
                must give this column a name. N:N relationships are not tied to a column the same way and one does not
                need to be
                created to create an N:N relationship. A “hidden” table is created to enable an N:N relationship. This
                table cannot be
                accessed through Dynamics – it can only be queried using FetchXML in XRMToolBox. If you require the data
                that would be
                stored in this table please reference the Issues, Workarounds, and Ideal Solution section. Detailed
                instructions on
                creating relationships can be found

                <h5><i>Subgrids</i></h5>
                Subgrids can be used to relate records in a N:N relationship. 2 subgrids are used on the Supervisor
                Application
                (advanced) form to receive input about the user’s Research Groups and ACM Keywords. Subgrids can be used
                on advanced
                forms but not on the first tab, if the form has multiple steps. Instructions on adding and configuring a
                subgrid can be

              <p>The final home of the JavaScript code performing the automatic matching algorithm is stored insinde the
                localised content of the administrator's matching page. However, during the development of the
                algorithm, the code was tested extensively in the node.js environment. This is because errors are much
                more verbose and useful than browser's consoles, and code could be quickly edited and re-tested, rather
                than waitng for a browser to load the page again every single time.
              </p>
              <p>Along the way, JSON files were generated containing various different pieces of information, ouputted
                from each stage of the algorithm. This was done since JSON is a very human-readble data format, and if a
                non-crashing, logic error ocurred during execution, the multiple output files could be traced back until
                the error was identified.
