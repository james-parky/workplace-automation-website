                One crude way to build a solution for our project may be to code
                it using a combination of HTML, Javascript, and CSS, whilst using
                an SQL database. However, this would be time consuming for such
                a complication project specification.
                <br><br>
                Luckily, a much easier and cleaner option was open to us. Our
                client for the project was Microsoft. As such, our project was
                particularly suited to using Microsoft products to increase the
                speed of our development.
                <br><br>
                After researching Microsoft development products, we decided to
                research Microsoft Power Apps. To do so, we both read through the
                <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/">official
                documentation</a>, and discussed this service at length with our
                clients representing Microsoft (Lee Stott, Ayca Bas), and a
                consultant representing the Ashton Court Group (Chris Seely), who
                acted as a mentor for us during this project.
                <br><br>
                Following these discussions and our research, it was determined that
                we would use the Microsoft Power Platform to develop our project.
                The reasons for this are as follows:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Dataverse Integration</strong> [1]
                    <br>
                    The Dataverse acts as a centralised location to store tables of
                    data. It is also designed to be integrated into Power Apps projects;
                    one may directly access the Dataverse through Power Apps. Data
                    may be easily retrieved, modified, deleted, or created, in the Dataverse
                    from Power Apps using <a href="#implementation">cloud flows</a>.
                    <br><br>
                    Through cloud flows, developers can also automate several interactions
                    with the data relevant to a certain project. This is useful for
                    many purposes within our project. For instance, within our project
                    it is expected that we may display a page of information about
                    supervisors to students. Using cloud flows, this page may be
                    updated whenever there is a new response.
                    <br><br>
                    Therefore, we predicted that the seamless integration between the Dataverse
                    and Power Apps would prove useful throughout our project, as almost
                    all of the requirements of our project concern the manipulation of data.
                  </li>
                  <br>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Rapid Code Deployment</strong> [2]
                    <br>
                    One of the primary purposes of using Power Apps is for rapid
                    project development. Time would largely be the limiting factor
                    of the development of this project. Power Apps lends itself to
                    this purpose - if required, one can deploy a website with zero
                    code. While we will use code to perform more advanced functions,
                    using Power Apps we were able to create a host a website
                    <i>immediately</i>.
                    <br><br>
                    For instance, the Power Apps Canvas may be used to create
                    components quickly without needing to write any html, Power Automate
                    may be used to perform logical processes to data, and website
                    organisation is already set up, allowing one to tweak website
                    settings or structure at will.
                  </li>
                  <br>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Multiple Platform Types</strong> [2]
                    <br>
                    For our app, we have three main user types, as detailed in the
                    requirements section. Each of these user types have different
                    needs and access levels. Within Power Apps, there are several
                    types of platform a developer may create, each with different
                    capabilities and use cases. Of these, there are three platforms
                    which may be suited to our project - <i>Canvas Apps, Portals, and
                    Model-Driven Apps.</i>
                    <br><br>
                    <u>Canvas Apps</u> [3]
                    <br>
                    A Canvas App is useful for creating a very simple space for
                    a user to view and interact with data. Canvas Apps are incredibly
                    quick to create - for instance, within a few clicks and zero lines
                    of code one may create a Canvas App to display a table imported from a
                    CSV file stored in the cloud. The drawback of a Canvas App is its
                    simplicity - a developer is not afforded much customisation, and fewer
                    opportunities are present for complex interaction between a users and the data.
                    <br><br>
                    <u>Portals</u> [4]
                    <br>
                    A Portal, like a Canvas App, allows a developer to create a
                    space for users to view and interact with data. However, a
                    Portal is useful for giving a user for complex ways to interact
                    with said data. For example, a developer has greater control over
                    the view and layout of a deployment, or for instance can enable
                    a developer to create more advanced forms for the user to fill out.
                    In a Portal, a user still remains somewhat limited in what they have
                    access to - a user is not naturally given permission and an easy way
                    to interact with data. Therefore, a Portal is great for a middle-ground,
                    when a user will need to make more complex interactions with the project,
                    but only requires limited access to the database and needs a straightforward
                    layout to perform a few specific procedures without being swamped with a
                    complicated page of information.

                    <u>Model-Driven Apps</u> [6]
                    <br>
                    A Model-Driven App affords the user with a high degree of visibility and
                    control over tables in the database. Through a PowerBI dashboard [7],
                    they may also see more complicated insights in the data, visualised. The
                    drawback to this is that a user may not always <i>need</i> such close interaction
                    with the database. Additionally, there is limited room to control the user
                    interface of a Model-Driven App - it has fewer options to be as attractive
                    and simple as a Portal or Canvas App. Therefore, it is suited to a situation
                    where the user needs a high degree of interaction with a large portion of the
                    database, and will be have some pre-requisite knowledge of how to navigate and
                    use it.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <br>
                To reflect on our user types; Firstly, we have an administrator who needs a large
                amount of control over the data stored in the solution and can be easily
                familiarised with the project. Secondly, students and professors - who need a
                high amount of controlled interaction with the data, but will not necessarily
                all be familiar with how to use the project.
                <br><br>
                As a result, it appears the
                appropriate platforms to build our project with would be a model-driven app for
                the administrator, and a portal for the students and academics.
                <br><br>

                <strong>Project Operations</strong> [5]
                <br>
                A Power Apps solution may be extended using
                Project Operations. As described in Microsoft
                Official Documentation, Project Operations can be used for "easy
                resource workload distribution" and "skillset matching to meet
                demands" [5]. This fits our requirements well, as we need to
                match the skillsets of students and academics as closely as 
                possible to find the optimal project for both. This would eliminate
                the need to manually develop a matching algorithms ourselves -
                development would be significantly sped up as Project Operations would
                generate this algorithms for us
                <br><br>
                There are, however, drawbacks to using Project Operations. These are:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Limited Control</strong> - while a built in allocation
                    algorithm would speep up development, naturally there would be
                    a more limited amount of control in its implementation. For
                    instance, micro-parameters may not be available for a developer
                    to tweak, and a developer is not give so much control of the
                    algorithms itself which is used in allocation.
                  </li>
                  <br>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Licence Fees</strong> - to use Project Operations, one
                    must pay a licence fee in addition to the Power Apps fee [8]. 
                    For a basic plan, this is £90.50 per user. If the matching
                    algorithm can be coded by hand, the amount of money saved would
                    be immense in the long run - especially when considering there
                    would likely be several users to pay for.
                  </li>
                  <br>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Longevity</strong> - linked to the above point on limited control,
                    using Project Operations makes the matching algorithm entirely tied to and
                    reliant on Project Operations. The world of technology moves quickly, and
                    it is not unlikely that at some point in the future, Project Operations
                    could become obselete, or be changed in a way which affects our project.
                  </li>
                  <br>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Project Specialisation</strong> - using an out-of-the-box algorithm
                    from Project Operations makes it more difficult to specialise and
                    optimise this algorithm to suit our project. For example, it is difficult
                    to specify if we would want to use an algorithm which prioritises the quality
                    of matches compared to one which prioritises making sure each academic has
                    at least one match.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Reproducibility</strong> - the Project Operations allocation algorithm
                    is reproducible in the sense that it is straightforward, and so the process for
                    using it in two different projects is simple. However, for projects with more
                    nuances, the stripped-down interaction with the algorithm means one will
                    struggle to apply more complicated aspects to similar projects. For instance,
                    take an example of a similar project such as allocating teaching assistants to
                    modules. If an allocation algorithm were manually coded, one could read the previous
                    for help, or code it in a more general way which allows the algorithm to be applied to
                    a range of things whilst maintaining the ability to cater to nuances. If Project
                    Operations is used, a developer would simply need to build the solution from
                    square one again, and may again struggle to deal with specific issues within a
                    particular project.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                As a result of this analysis, we decided that it would be more beneficial
                to code the matching algorithm manually - our project is fairly specialised
                and so would suffer under the contraints of Project Operations using a general
                skills-based allocation algorithm with limited control. Secondly, given the
                number of users interacting with our project, the cost may become extremely
                high. Lastly, there are many situations within UCL where an automated allocation
                algorithm would be of great help. It would therefore be of great benefit to have a
                coded allocation algorithm which may be applied in a similar way to many projects.

                  Flows are pieces of logic which allow some level of automation to otherwise static objects, such as
                  tables. Flows can be triggered by
                  several things, like the manual press of a button, the modification of a particular table, or the
                  arrival of a certain time of day.
                  They can be used to do things like edit data in a table or send an email. Below are some of the most
                  important ways in which we used
                  flows:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Add Contact Field to Supervisor ACM</strong>
                    <br>
                    This flow is triggered by the addition/modification/deletion of a record inside Supervisor Responses
                    v2. When a Supervisor Application is submitted/modified/deleted, a record is created inside
                    Supervisor-ACM and the ID, ACM Keyword, and Supervisor Response ID fields are populated in that
                    record. This flow is used to populate the remaining Contact field of this new record. The flow does
                    this by extracting the Contact field from the newly modified Supervisor Response record and
                    inserting it into the Supervisor-ACM records belonging to that supervisor.
                    <br><br>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Create Student-ACM Record</strong>
                    <br>
                    This flow is triggered by the addition/modification/deletion of a record inside Student Responses.
                    When a Student Application is submitted/modified/deleted, a record is created inside Student
                    Responses. We also want to create records inside Student-ACM, populating the columns ACM Keyword and
                    Contact. The First-choice Interest field is extracted from the submitted record, and this is mapped
                    to ACM Keywords using the Topic-ACM Maps. A record is created for the student associating them with
                    each of these ACM keywords.
                    <br><br>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Insert Topic-ACM Records</strong>
                    <br>
                    This flow is triggered manually, and was created for the purpose of efficiently populating the
                    lookup table which maps student topics to ACM keywords. It works by extracting all ACM keywords
                    pertaining to a certain section and creating a row in the lookup table mapping the keyword to a
                    particular student topic. For example, it may select all ACM keywords beginning with '2.1', and
                    create a record mapping them to 'Algorithms and CS Core Theory'.

                  Forms belong to tables. To create a form with X number of fields, you must first create a table with
                  the
                  same matching X number of columns. The data collected by filling out this form is stored in this table
                  in the respective columns. There are 2 main Insert forms used by the portal:
                </p>

                    <br>
                    This can be found in PowerApps inside Supervisor Responses v2 (table) > Supervisor Responses v2 main
                    form. It should be accessed this way to customize the fields that appear on the form (and each
                    individual tab). It can be further customized through Portal Management > Advanced Forms >
                    Supervisor
                    Application. Here, it is possible to reorder the steps of the form and manage form Sessions. To
                    configure subgrids on this form, you should go to Portal Management > Basic Forms > Supervisor
                    Application v2 > Related > Advanced Form Metadata. It may be confusing that there is both a Basic
                    Form
                    and an Advanced Form for the supervisor application, however they are both linked to the Supervisor
                    Responses v2 main form (under the Supervisor Responses v2 table), so they work in harmony.

                  If you want to manually add a record to a table, you go to the
                  Table Name > Data > Add record. This opens a new tab and shows
                  the default Information (main) form, which is simplistic by
                  default and may only show 2 fields. To alter this and allow more
                  fields to be populated this way, edit the Information form
                  (of type Main, as opposed to Card or QuickViewForm). If you have
                  multiple main forms, the pop-up tab may open in either of the
                  main forms. You can select which main form you want to fill out
                  using the drop down menu on the form tab. Advanced forms can
                  support multiple steps, branching (I.e. conditional steps), and
                  subgrids, all of which cannot be achieved with basic forms. Here

                  Liquid is a template language, written amongst HTML that uses a combination of objects, tags, and
                  filters inside template files to display dynamic content. Liquid, like any template language, creates
                  a
                  bridge between an HTML file and a data store — in our context, the data we use for matching.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Liquid can be learnt fairly quickly using the <a
                    href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/">official documentation</a>.
                  Here are some examples where we used Liquid in our project:
                </p>

                <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
                  <u>Hiding Sensitive Data During Development</u>
                  <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                    <li>At times during our development, we needed to display data that should be available to
                      authenticated users <strong>only</strong>.
                      To do this, we used Liquid <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/tags/control-flow/">control
                        flow</a> tags to show or hide data
                      based on this condition:
                    </li>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>{% <span style="color: #1BB1DC">if user</span> %}</strong></li>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>{% <span style="color: #1BB1DC;">include 'my_page'</span>
                        %}</strong></li>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>{% <span style="color: #1BB1DC;">endif</span> %}</strong></li>
                    <br>
                    <li>If the user is not signed in, <strong>'user'</strong> will not exist, meaning the variable holds
                      a
                      value
                      of <strong>'Nil'</strong>. This means the <strong>'user'</strong> variable is
                      <strong>'falsy'</strong>, causing the condition to be
                      evaluated as <strong>false</strong> and therefore not display <strong>my_page</strong>.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>It should be noted that this is <strong>not</strong> the most sound and elegant solution to hide
                      content from the unauthorised.
                      PowerApps offers mechanisms to acheive this through <a href="#documentation-web_roles">Web
                        Roles</a>.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <br>
                  <u>Displaying User-Specific Information</u>
                  <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                    <li>It's often useful to have a webpage display different content depending on who the user is, and
                      what information we have about them.
                      Objects may have certain attributes which can be used to acheive this. As a simple example, we
                      used:
                    </li>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>{{ <span style="color: #1BB1DC;">user.fullname</span> }}</strong></li>
                    <li>to display a header which display the correct name for the user that's currently logged in.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <br>
                  <u>Iteration to Display Elements in an Array</u>
                  <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                    <li>Under different conditions, different content may need to be included in the header. We used
                      Liquid to display all headings which
                      should be displayed within a given Web Link Set. Here is a heavily simplified method with which we
                      did this:
                    </li>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>{% <span style="color: #1BB1DC;">for link in primary_nav.sublinks</span>
                        %}</strong></li>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>{% <span style="color: #1BB1DC;">unless forloop.first</span>
                        %}</strong></li>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&lt;div
                        style="vertical-divider"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</strong></li>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>{% <span style="color: #1BB1DC;">endunless</span> %}</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>{{ <span style="color: #1BB1DC;">link.name</span> }}</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>{% <span style="color: #1BB1DC;">endfor</span> %}</strong></li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>

                    <strong>Collection of Data</strong>
                    <p>Since our code is written in pure JavaScript, the required data is pulled from our solution’s
                      database using simple http GET requests. There are 5 different requests, that pull 5 separate sets
                      of data. This data is initially collected using PowerAutomate instant cloud flows (As seen above).
                      The flow can be broken down into three steps.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="matchgin__flow-steps" style="list-style: none;">

                        <p>
                          As you can see by this image, the flow is waiting for a GET request to its specified API. Upon
                          receiving this request. Since the request doesnt need to send any data initially, the payload
                          format is left empyty. </p>
                      </li>
                      <li style="display:inline-block">
                        <img src="assets/img/implementation/matching/list_rows.png" alt="">
                        <p>Next, the flow performs a ‘list rows’ operation on the specified table to get all of
                          the lists into a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. Only the rows containing data
                          necessary
                          for matching are included to reduce the size of the payload sent back to our code. In this
                          case, the rows: 'acmclassificationcodesid', 'keyword', and 'id' are pulled from the 'ACM
                          Classification Codes' table.</p>

                        <p>Finally, an http request
                          of code 200 is sent back, including the JSON formatted list of data. This procedure is
                          repeated 5 times, once for each different table that we require data from.</p>
                      </li>

                  <li>
                    <strong>Cleaning the Received Data</strong>
                    <p>When the data for each table is received by the code, it needs to be cleaned and put into a named
                      JavaScript object, so that it can be easily accessed by the algorithm.
                      Here is an example of the aforementioned get requests. The data is initially fetched from the API
                      of the flow pulling data from the desired table. The data is then parsed into a new JavaScript
                      object, with more human-readble attribute names.
                      Data is also 'cleaned' where it needs to be. For example, in this function, we remove any records
                      that do not have a specified 'responseId.'
                    </p>
                    <img src="assets/img/implementation/matching/code/get_request.png" alt="">
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Parsing of the Data</strong>
                    <p>The received student data and supervisor data is then parsed into a more usable format. This is
                      done for multiple reasons. Firstly, when a student fills out a response form, they choose which
                      rough topics they have interests in. Each one of these topics relate to hundreds of ACM keywords.
                      Therefore the ACM keywords need to be collated into one student response object.
                      Secondly, when a supervisor fills out a response form, a news Supervisor-ACM table record is
                      generated for each ACM keyword they selected as relevant to them. To make matching more simple,
                      these too are collated so that there is only one supervisor response object per unique supervisor,
                      having many ACM keywords related to it.
                    </p>
                    <p>The below example shows the supervisor response parsing function. It can be seen that when
                      sorting through Supervisor-ACM table records, responses that have a responseId that has already
                      been used, have their ACM keywords appended to the already exisiting object, rather than creating
                      a new one.</p>

                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Finding All Possible Matches</strong>
                    <p>The next process is to find all possible students matched to each supervisor. These matches are
                      found based on whether the supervisor and student share an common ACM keyword in their responses.
                      If a student is found to match to a supervisor, the student's response object is inserted into an
                      array
                      of 'matched students' for the supervisor. This also contains the ACM keyword that they matched on,
                      and the priority that the student assigned to it.
                      This process is repeated for all students for all supervisors.</p>
                    <p>Below is the actual code for finding matches. It simply loops through each parsed supervisor
                      response object (formed in the previous step) and calls the findMatchingStudents function.
                      The findMatchingStudents function then loops through each parsed student response object and sees
                      if the response contains an ACM keyword that is also present in the current supervisor resposne
                      object.
                      If so, the student object is added to the supervisors list of matched students, as described
                      above.
                      The list of matches to that sueprvisor is returned.
                      This is repeated for every supervisor.
                    </p>

                  <li>
                    <strong>Ordering</strong>
                    <p>Then, for each supervisor, the matches are ordered based on the priority that the student
                      assigned
                      to the ACM keyword that they matched with the supervisor on.</p>
                    <img src="assets/img/implementation/matching/code/ordering.png" alt="">
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Reviewing the Matches</strong>
                    <p>The final stage of the code for the matching process, is the matches review. For each supervisor,
                      the matches that were found are reviewed one by one. Using the total number of unique student
                      responses and supervisor responses, a minimum number of matches per supervsior is calculated. Each
                      professor then has that many of their students matches 'finalised' and inserted into a final
                      matches
                      array. This is why the student matches list was orderd for each professor in the previous step.
                    </p>
                    <p>This section of code also creates a list of any supervisors that were left with no students
                      matched
                      to them at the end of this process. This should only ever happend because there were more
                      supervisors than students, not because there were no students interesting in doing what the
                      supervisor was willing to supervise - although that is still theoretically possible.</p>
                    <img src="assets/img/implementation/matching/code/review.png" alt="">
                    <p>In a similar way, this piece of code finds any students that could't be matched to any of the
                      supervisors. Again, in practice this will probably never happen since the topics that student
                      choose
                      as interests in their response encompass a vast amount of ACM keywords. However, since it is still
                      techinally possible, it is handled, since it would be usefull to the administrator. </p>

                    <strong>Sending the Matches Back to Our Solution</strong>
                    <p>After all of the matches between students and superviors have been reviewed, and matchless
                      supervisors and students have been found, the data is properly formatted and sent back to our
                      solution's database using an http POST request. </p>

                    <p>The flow then iterates through the payload to extract all 'pairs' between a supervisor and
                      student. From each pair, it takes the studentResponseId and supervisorResponseId associated with
                      the pair. It uses these ID's to get the contacts of the people that submitted the responses.</p>

                <h5><i>1:N, N:1, and N:N Relationships</i></h5>
                In PowerApps, a N:1 relationship is called a Lookup. A 1:N relationship is simply a reversed Lookup
                (lookup from the
                other table into this one). Creating either of these will create a column in the table that holds the
                lookup, and you
                must give this column a name. N:N relationships are not tied to a column the same way and one does not
                need to be
                created to create an N:N relationship. A “hidden” table is created to enable an N:N relationship. This
                table cannot be
                accessed through Dynamics – it can only be queried using FetchXML in XRMToolBox. If you require the data
                that would be
                stored in this table please reference the Issues, Workarounds, and Ideal Solution section. Detailed
                instructions on
                creating relationships can be found

                <h5><i>Subgrids</i></h5>
                Subgrids can be used to relate records in a N:N relationship. 2 subgrids are used on the Supervisor
                Application
                (advanced) form to receive input about the user’s Research Groups and ACM Keywords. Subgrids can be used
                on advanced
                forms but not on the first tab, if the form has multiple steps. Instructions on adding and configuring a
