                  Flows are pieces of logic which allow some level of automation to otherwise static objects, such as
                  tables. Flows can be triggered by
                  several things, like the manual press of a button, the modification of a particular table, or the
                  arrival of a certain time of day.
                  They can be used to do things like edit data in a table or send an email. Below are some of the most
                  important ways in which we used
                  flows:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Add Contact Field to Supervisor ACM</strong>
                    <p>
                      This flow is triggered by the addition/modification/deletion of a record inside Supervisor
                      Responses
                      v2. When a Supervisor Application is submitted/modified/deleted, a record is created inside
                      Supervisor-ACM and the ID, ACM Keyword, and Supervisor Response ID fields are populated in that
                      record. This flow is used to populate the remaining Contact field of this new record. The flow
                      does
                      this by extracting the Contact field from the newly modified Supervisor Response record and
                      inserting it into the Supervisor-ACM records belonging to that supervisor.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Create Student-ACM Record</strong>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                      This flow is triggered by the addition/modification/deletion of a record inside Student Responses.
                      When a Student Application is submitted/modified/deleted, a record is created inside Student
                      Responses. We also want to create records inside Student-ACM, populating the columns ACM Keyword
                      and
                      Contact. The First-choice Interest field is extracted from the submitted record, and this is
                      mapped
                      to ACM Keywords using the Topic-ACM Maps. A record is created for the student associating them
                      with
                      each of these ACM keywords.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Insert Topic-ACM Records</strong>
                    <p>
                      This flow is triggered manually, and was created for the purpose of efficiently populating the
                      lookup table which maps student topics to ACM keywords. It works by extracting all ACM keywords
                      pertaining to a certain section and creating a row in the lookup table mapping the keyword to a
                      particular student topic. For example, it may select all ACM keywords beginning with '2.1', and
                      create a record mapping them to 'Algorithms and CS Core Theory'.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Assign Web Role to Contact</strong>
                    <p>This flow is triggered when a user signs in on the Portal for the first time and selects a role.
                      The flow is expecting a request with a JSON payload of a specific shape. This payload contains the
                      id of the currently signed-in user, along with the id of the web role that they just selected. The
                      flow then relates the record of the currently signed-in user in the Contact table with the record
                      of the selected web role in the Web Roles Table. Doing this gives the permissions of that web role
                      to the user.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Update Student Responses Availability</strong>
                    <p>This is the longest and most complex flow in the solution and is triggered by the
                      addition/modification of record inside the Supervisor-Student Pairs table. When a pair record is
                      added or editted in this table, there are two things that may happen depending on the value of the
                      'Approved' field in the record in focus.</p>
                    <p>If this has a value of 'Rejected,' meaning the supervisor didn't approve the match, the student
                      response of that match has it's 'Availability' field set to 'Yes.' Then, if the matches supervisor
                      has a remaining capacity less than the actual capacity, the supervior's 'Availability' is set to
                      'Yes' as well.</p>
                    <p>If instead the value is 'Approved,' if the matches supervisor's remaining capacity is equal to 0,
                      meaning they cannot facilitate any more students, the supervior's 'Availability' is set to 'No,'

                  Forms belong to tables. To create a form with X number of fields, you must first create a table with
                  the
                  same matching X number of columns. The data collected by filling out this form is stored in this table
                  in the respective columns. There are 2 main Insert forms used by the portal:

                    form. It should be accessed this way to customize the fields that appear on the form (and each
                    individual tab). It can be further customized through Portal Management > Advanced Forms >
                    Supervisor
                    Application. Here, it is possible to reorder the steps of the form and manage form Sessions. To

                    Form
                    and an Advanced Form for the supervisor application, however they are both linked to the Supervisor
                    Responses v2 main form (under the Supervisor Responses v2 table), so they work in harmony.

                  If you want to manually add a record to a table, you go to the
                  Table Name > Data > Add record. This opens a new tab and shows
                  the default Information (main) form, which is simplistic by
                  default and may only show 2 fields. To alter this and allow more
                  fields to be populated this way, edit the Information form
                  (of type Main, as opposed to Card or QuickViewForm). If you have
                  multiple main forms, the pop-up tab may open in either of the
                  main forms. You can select which main form you want to fill out
                  using the drop down menu on the form tab. Advanced forms can
                  support multiple steps, branching (I.e. conditional steps), and
                  subgrids, all of which cannot be achieved with basic forms. Here

                  Liquid is a template language, written amongst HTML that uses a combination of objects, tags, and
                  filters inside template files to display dynamic content. Liquid, like any template language, creates
                  a
                  bridge between an HTML file and a data store — in our context, the data we use for matching.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Liquid can be learnt fairly quickly using the <a
                    href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/">official documentation</a>.
                  Here are some examples where we used Liquid in our project:
                </p>

                <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
                  <u>Hiding Sensitive Data During Development</u>
                  <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                    <li>At times during our development, we needed to display data that should be available to
                      authenticated users <strong>only</strong>.
                      To do this, we used Liquid <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/tags/control-flow/">control
                        flow</a> tags to show or hide data
                      based on this condition:
                    </li>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>{% <span style="color: #1BB1DC">if user</span> %}</strong></li>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>{% <span style="color: #1BB1DC;">include 'my_page'</span>
                        %}</strong></li>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>{% <span style="color: #1BB1DC;">endif</span> %}</strong></li>
                    <br>
                    <li>If the user is not signed in, <strong>'user'</strong> will not exist, meaning the variable holds
                      a
                      value
                      of <strong>'Nil'</strong>. This means the <strong>'user'</strong> variable is
                      <strong>'falsy'</strong>, causing the condition to be
                      evaluated as <strong>false</strong> and therefore not display <strong>my_page</strong>.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>It should be noted that this is <strong>not</strong> the most sound and elegant solution to hide
                      content from the unauthorised.
                      PowerApps offers mechanisms to acheive this through <a href="#documentation-web_roles">Web
                        Roles</a>.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <br>
                  <u>Displaying User-Specific Information</u>
                  <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                    <li>It's often useful to have a webpage display different content depending on who the user is, and
                      what information we have about them.
                      Objects may have certain attributes which can be used to acheive this. As a simple example, we
                      used:
                    </li>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>{{ <span style="color: #1BB1DC;">user.fullname</span> }}</strong></li>
                    <li>to display a header which display the correct name for the user that's currently logged in.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <br>
                  <u>Iteration to Display Elements in an Array</u>
                  <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                    <li>Under different conditions, different content may need to be included in the header. We used
                      Liquid to display all headings which
                      should be displayed within a given Web Link Set. Here is a heavily simplified method with which we
                      did this:
                    </li>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>{% <span style="color: #1BB1DC;">for link in primary_nav.sublinks</span>
                        %}</strong></li>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>{% <span style="color: #1BB1DC;">unless forloop.first</span>
                        %}</strong></li>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&lt;div
                        style="vertical-divider"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</strong></li>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>{% <span style="color: #1BB1DC;">endunless</span> %}</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>{{ <span style="color: #1BB1DC;">link.name</span> }}</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>{% <span style="color: #1BB1DC;">endfor</span> %}</strong></li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>

                <p>We had initially decided to use Project Operations for the supervised matching section of our
                  solution. However, after closer inspection of how the matching works in Project Operations, we decided
                  that we wouldn’t have enough control over how students were matched to supervisors. Instead, we
                  created a custom algorithm using Javascript.</p>

                <p>Our matching process can be split into 5 main, distinct components. </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Collection of Data</strong>
                    <p>Since our code is written in pure JavaScript, the required data is pulled from our solution’s
                      database using simple http GET requests. There are 5 different requests, that pull 5 separate sets
                      of data. This data is initially collected using PowerAutomate instant cloud flows (As seen above).
                      The flow can be broken down into three steps.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="matchgin__flow-steps" style="list-style: none;">

                        <img src="assets/img/implementation/matching/http_get.png" alt="">
                        <p>
                          As you can see by this image, the flow is waiting for a GET request to its specified API. Upon
                          receiving this request. Since the request doesnt need to send any data initially, the payload
                          format is left empyty. </p>
                      </li>
                      <li style="display:inline-block">
                        <img src="assets/img/implementation/matching/list_rows.png" alt="">
                        <p>Next, the flow performs a ‘list rows’ operation on the specified table to get all of
                          the lists into a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. Only the rows containing data
                          necessary
                          for matching are included to reduce the size of the payload sent back to our code. In this
                          case, the rows: 'acmclassificationcodesid', 'keyword', and 'id' are pulled from the 'ACM
                          Classification Codes' table.</p>
                      </li>

                        <p>Finally, an http request
                          of code 200 is sent back, including the JSON formatted list of data. This procedure is
                          repeated 5 times, once for each different table that we require data from.</p>
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                  <li>
                    <strong>Cleaning the Received Data</strong>
                    <p>When the data for each table is received by the code, it needs to be cleaned and put into a named
                      JavaScript object, so that it can be easily accessed by the algorithm.
                      Here is an example of the aforementioned get requests. The data is initially fetched from the API
                      of the flow pulling data from the desired table. The data is then parsed into a new JavaScript
                      object, with more human-readble attribute names.
                      Data is also 'cleaned' where it needs to be. For example, in this function, we remove any records
                      that do not have a specified 'responseId.'
                    </p>
                    <img src="assets/img/implementation/matching/code/get_request.png" alt="">
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Parsing of the Data</strong>
                    <p>The received student data and supervisor data is then parsed into a more usable format. This is
                      done for multiple reasons. Firstly, when a student fills out a response form, they choose which
                      rough topics they have interests in. Each one of these topics relate to hundreds of ACM keywords.
                      Therefore the ACM keywords need to be collated into one student response object.
                      Secondly, when a supervisor fills out a response form, a news Supervisor-ACM table record is
                      generated for each ACM keyword they selected as relevant to them. To make matching more simple,
                      these too are collated so that there is only one supervisor response object per unique supervisor,
                      having many ACM keywords related to it.
                    </p>
                    <p>The below example shows the supervisor response parsing function. It can be seen that when
                      sorting through Supervisor-ACM table records, responses that have a responseId that has already
                      been used, have their ACM keywords appended to the already exisiting object, rather than creating
                      a new one.</p>
                    <img src="assets/img/implementation/matching/code/supervisor_parse.png" alt="">
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Finding All Possible Matches</strong>
                    <p>The next process is to find all possible students matched to each supervisor. These matches are
                      found based on whether the supervisor and student share an common ACM keyword in their responses.
                      If a student is found to match to a supervisor, the student's response object is inserted into an
                      array
                      of 'matched students' for the supervisor. This also contains the ACM keyword that they matched on,
                      and the priority that the student assigned to it.
                      This process is repeated for all students for all supervisors.</p>
                    <p>Below is the actual code for finding matches. It simply loops through each parsed supervisor
                      response object (formed in the previous step) and calls the findMatchingStudents function.
                      The findMatchingStudents function then loops through each parsed student response object and sees
                      if the response contains an ACM keyword that is also present in the current supervisor resposne
                      object.
                      If so, the student object is added to the supervisors list of matched students, as described
                      above.
                      The list of matches to that sueprvisor is returned.
                      This is repeated for every supervisor.

                    <strong>Ordering</strong>
                    <p>Then, for each supervisor, the matches are ordered based on the priority that the student
                      assigned
                      to the ACM keyword that they matched with the supervisor on.</p>

                  <li>
                    <strong>Reviewing the Matches</strong>
                    <p>The final stage of the code for the matching process, is the matches review. For each supervisor,
                      the matches that were found are reviewed one by one. Using the total number of unique student
                      responses and supervisor responses, a minimum number of matches per supervsior is calculated. Each
                      professor then has that many of their students matches 'finalised' and inserted into a final
                      matches
                      array. This is why the student matches list was orderd for each professor in the previous step.
                    </p>
                    <p>This section of code also creates a list of any supervisors that were left with no students
                      matched
                      to them at the end of this process. This should only ever happend because there were more
                      supervisors than students, not because there were no students interesting in doing what the
                      supervisor was willing to supervise - although that is still theoretically possible.</p>
                    <img src="assets/img/implementation/matching/code/review.png" alt="">
                    <p>In a similar way, this piece of code finds any students that could't be matched to any of the
                      supervisors. Again, in practice this will probably never happen since the topics that student
                      choose
                      as interests in their response encompass a vast amount of ACM keywords. However, since it is still
                      techinally possible, it is handled, since it would be usefull to the administrator. </p>

                    <strong>Sending the Matches Back to Our Solution</strong>
                    <p>After all of the matches between students and superviors have been reviewed, and matchless
                      supervisors and students have been found, the data is properly formatted and sent back to our
                      solution's database using an http POST request. </p>
                    <img src="assets/img/implementation/matching/code/post_request.png" alt="">
                    <p>There is another flow in our solution waiting for
                      a POST request to a specific API, expecting a payload containing a specifically shapped JSON.</p>
                    <img src="assets/img/implementation/matching/post_request.png" alt="">
                    <p>The flow then iterates through the payload to extract all 'pairs' between a supervisor and
                      student. From each pair, it takes the studentResponseId and supervisorResponseId associated with
                      the pair. It uses these ID's to get the contacts of the people that submitted the responses.</p>

                <p>The above mentioned 'Matching Algorithm' is the backend logic for what happens during the matching
                  process, but how is it actually triggered?</p>
                <p>The administrator has sole access to a page on our portal wesbite from where the supervised matching
                  process can be initiated. The administrator is presented with instructions on how to use the page,
                  is given a button to click, and a label displays the current status of the algorithm. This is shown
                  below.</p>
                <img src="assets/img/implementation/matching/matching_page_initial.png" alt="">
                <p>After the administrator clicks the button and the above described matching algorithm has taken place,
                  the status label is updated, as seen below.
                </p>
                <img src="assets/img/implementation/matching/matching_page_status_completed.png" alt="">
                <p>As described in the above section, the results from the matching algorithm are inputted into the
                  'Supervisor-Student Pairs' table, which is viewable by the administrator. Here the matches can be
                  reviewed and then approved or rejected. When a pair record is editted as shown below, a PowerAutomate
                  instant flow is run, which performs the following logic.</p>
                <img src="assets/img/implementation/matching/edit_status_of_pair.png" alt="">
                <p>
                  If a pair is rejected by an administrator, the involved student's availability is set to 'Yes' and if
                  the supervisor's remaining capacity is less than their total capacity, the supervisor's availability
                  is also set to 'Yes.'
                </p>
                <p>
                  If a pair is instead accpeted by an administrator, if the supervior's remaining capacity is equal to
                  0, the student's availability is set to 'Yes,' the supervisor's availability is set to 'No' and the
                  pairs status is set to 'Rejected.' Otheriwise, the students availability is set to 'No' and the
                  supervisor's remaining capacity is reduced by 1.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The administrator should review matches and rerun the algorithm
                  until they are completely satisfied with the outcome.

                <h5><i>1:N, N:1, and N:N Relationships</i></h5>
                In PowerApps, a N:1 relationship is called a Lookup. A 1:N relationship is simply a reversed Lookup
                (lookup from the
                other table into this one). Creating either of these will create a column in the table that holds the
                lookup, and you
                must give this column a name. N:N relationships are not tied to a column the same way and one does not
                need to be
                created to create an N:N relationship. A “hidden” table is created to enable an N:N relationship. This
                table cannot be
                accessed through Dynamics – it can only be queried using FetchXML in XRMToolBox. If you require the data
                that would be
                stored in this table please reference the Issues, Workarounds, and Ideal Solution section. Detailed
                instructions on
                creating relationships can be found

                <h5><i>Subgrids</i></h5>
                Subgrids can be used to relate records in a N:N relationship. 2 subgrids are used on the Supervisor
                Application
                (advanced) form to receive input about the user’s Research Groups and ACM Keywords. Subgrids can be used
                on advanced
                forms but not on the first tab, if the form has multiple steps. Instructions on adding and configuring a
