                  Flows are pieces of logic which allow some level of automation to otherwise static objects, such as tables. Flows can be triggered by
                  several things, like the manual press of a button, the modification of a particular table, or the arrival of a certain time of day.
                  They can be used to do things like edit data in a table or send an email. Below are some of the most important ways in which we used
                  flows:
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Add Contact Field to Supervisor ACM</strong>
                      <br>
                      This flow is triggered by the addition/modification/deletion of a record inside Supervisor Responses v2. When a Supervisor Application is submitted/modified/deleted, a record is created inside Supervisor-ACM and the ID, ACM Keyword, and Supervisor Response ID fields are populated in that record. This flow is used to populate the remaining Contact field of this new record. The flow does this by extracting the Contact field from the newly modified Supervisor Response record and inserting it into the Supervisor-ACM records belonging to that supervisor.
                      <br><br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Create Student-ACM Record</strong>
                      <br>
                      This flow is triggered by the addition/modification/deletion of a record inside Student Responses. When a Student Application is submitted/modified/deleted, a record is created inside Student Responses. We also want to create records inside Student-ACM, populating the columns ACM Keyword and Contact. The First-choice Interest field is extracted from the submitted record, and this is mapped to ACM Keywords using the Topic-ACM Maps. A record is created for the student associating them with each of these ACM keywords.
                      <br><br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Insert Topic-ACM Records</strong>
                      <br>
                      This flow is triggered manually, and was created for the purpose of efficiently populating the lookup table which maps student topics to ACM keywords. It works by extracting all ACM keywords pertaining to a certain section and creating a row in the lookup table mapping the keyword to a particular student topic. For example, it may select all ACM keywords beginning with '2.1', and create a record mapping them to 'Algorithms and CS Core Theory'.
                      <br><br>
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </div>

                    Forms belong to tables. To create a form with X number of fields, you must first create a table with the same matching X number of columns. The data collected by filling out this form is stored in this table in the respective columns. There are 2 main Insert forms used by the portal:
                  </p>

                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Supervisor Application</strong>
                      <br>
                      This can be found in PowerApps inside Supervisor Responses v2 (table) > Supervisor Responses v2 main form. It should be accessed this way to customize the fields that appear on the form (and each individual tab). It can be further customized through Portal Management > Advanced Forms > Supervisor Application. Here, it is possible to reorder the steps of the form and manage form Sessions. To configure subgrids on this form, you should go to Portal Management > Basic Forms > Supervisor Application v2 > Related > Advanced Form Metadata. It may be confusing that there is both a Basic Form and an Advanced Form for the supervisor application, however they are both linked to the Supervisor Responses v2 main form (under the Supervisor Responses v2 table), so they work in harmony.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Student Application</strong>
                      <br>
                      This can be found in PowerApps inside Student Responses > Student Responses main form. It should be accessed this way to customize the fields that appear on the form (and each individual tab). It can be further customized through Portal Management > Advanced Forms > Student Application. Here, it is possible to reorder the steps of the form and manage form Sessions.

                  <p>
                    If you want to manually add a record to a table, you go to the
                    Table Name > Data > Add record. This opens a new tab and shows
                    the default Information (main) form, which is simplistic by
                    default and may only show 2 fields. To alter this and allow more
                    fields to be populated this way, edit the Information form
                    (of type Main, as opposed to Card or QuickViewForm). If you have
                    multiple main forms, the pop-up tab may open in either of the
                    main forms. You can select which main form you want to fill out
                    using the drop down menu on the form tab. Advanced forms can
                    support multiple steps, branching (I.e. conditional steps), and
                    subgrids, all of which cannot be achieved with basic forms. Here

                    Liquid is a template language, written amongst HTML that uses a combination of objects, tags, and filters inside template files to display dynamic content. Liquid, like any template language, creates a bridge between an HTML file and a data store — in our context, the data we use for matching.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Liquid can be learnt fairly quickly using the <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/">official documentation</a>.
                    Here are some examples where we used Liquid in our project:
                  </p>

                  <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
                    <u>Hiding Sensitive Data During Development</u>
                    <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                        <li>At times during our development, we needed to display data that should be available to authenticated users <strong>only</strong>.
                            To do this, we used Liquid <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/tags/control-flow/">control flow</a> tags to show or hide data 
                            based on this condition:
                        </li>
                        <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>{% <span style="color: #1BB1DC">if user</span> %}</strong></li>
                        <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>{% <span style="color: #1BB1DC;">include 'my_page'</span> %}</strong></li>
                        <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>{% <span style="color: #1BB1DC;">endif</span> %}</strong></li>
                        <br>
                        <li>If the user is not signed in, <strong>'user'</strong> will not exist, meaning the variable holds a value
                            of <strong>'Nil'</strong>. This means the <strong>'user'</strong> variable is <strong>'falsy'</strong>, causing the condition to be
                            evaluated as <strong>false</strong> and therefore not display <strong>my_page</strong>.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>It should be noted that this is <strong>not</strong> the most sound and elegant solution to hide content from the unauthorised.
                            PowerApps offers mechanisms to acheive this through <a href="#documentation-web_roles">Web Roles</a>.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <u>Displaying User-Specific Information</u>
                    <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                        <li>It's often useful to have a webpage display different content depending on who the user is, and what information we have about them.
                            Objects may have certain attributes which can be used to acheive this. As a simple example, we used:
                        </li>
                        <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>{{ <span style="color: #1BB1DC;">user.fullname</span> }}</strong></li>
                        <li>to display a header which display the correct name for the user that's currently logged in.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <u>Iteration to Display Elements in an Array</u>
                    <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                        <li>Under different conditions, different content may need to be included in the header. We used Liquid to display all headings which
                            should be displayed within a given Web Link Set. Here is a heavily simplified method with which we did this:
                        </li>
                        <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>{% <span style="color: #1BB1DC;">for link in primary_nav.sublinks</span> %}</strong></li>
                        <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>{% <span style="color: #1BB1DC;">unless forloop.first</span> %}</strong></li>
                        <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&lt;div style="vertical-divider"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</strong></li>
                        <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>{% <span style="color: #1BB1DC;">endunless</span> %}</strong></li>
                        <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>{{ <span style="color: #1BB1DC;">link.name</span> }}</strong></li>
                        <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>{% <span style="color: #1BB1DC;">endfor</span> %}</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                  </ul>

                </div>
            </div>

                    <strong>Collection of Data</strong>
                    <p>Since our code is written in pure JavaScript, the required data is pulled from our solution’s
                      database using simple http GET requests. There are 5 different requests, that pull 5 separate sets
                      of data. This data is initially collected using PowerAutomate instant cloud flows (As seen above).
                      The flow can be broken down into three steps.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="matchgin__flow-steps" style="text-align: center;list-style: none;">
                      <li style="display:inline-block">
                        <img src="assets/img/implementation/matching/http_get.png" alt="">
                        <p>
                          As you can see by this image, the flow is waiting for a GET request to its specified API. Upon
                          receiving this request. Since the request doesnt need to send any data initially, the payload
                          format is left empyty. </p>
                      </li>
                      <li style="display:inline-block">
                        <img src="assets/img/implementation/matching/list_rows.png" alt="">
                        <p>Next, the flow performs a ‘list rows’ operation on the specified table to get all of
                          the lists into a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. Only the rows containing data
                          necessary
                          for matching are included to reduce the size of the payload sent back to our code. In this
                          case, the rows: 'acmclassificationcodesid', 'keyword', and 'id' are pulled from the 'ACM
                          Classification Codes' table.</p>
                      </li>

                        <p>Finally, an http request
                          of code 200 is sent back, including the JSON formatted list of data. This procedure is
                          repeated 5 times, once for each different table that we require data from.</p>
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                  <li>
                    <strong>Cleaning the Received Data</strong>
                    <p>When the data for each table is received by the code, it needs to be cleaned and put into a named
                      JavaScript object, so that it can be easily accessed by the algorithm.
                      Here is an example of the aforementioned get requests. The data is initially fetched from the API
                      of the flow pulling data from the desired table. The data is then parsed into a new JavaScript
                      object, with more human-readble attribute names.
                      Data is also 'cleaned' where it needs to be. For example, in this function, we remove any records
                      that do not have a specified 'responseId.'
                    </p>
                    <img src="assets/img/implementation/matching/code/get_request.png" alt="">
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Parsing of the Data</strong>
                    <p>The received student data and supervisor data is then parsed into a more usable format. This is
                      done for multiple reasons. Firstly, when a student fills out a response form, they choose which
                      rough topics they have interests in. Each one of these topics relate to hundreds of ACM keywords.
                      Therefore the ACM keywords need to be collated into one student response object.
                      Secondly, when a supervisor fills out a response form, a news Supervisor-ACM table record is
                      generated for each ACM keyword they selected as relevant to them. To make matching more simple,
                      these too are collated so that there is only one supervisor response object per unique supervisor,
                      having many ACM keywords related to it.
                    </p>
                    <p>The below example shows the supervisor response parsing function. It can be seen that when
                      sorting through Supervisor-ACM table records, responses that have a responseId that has already
                      been used, have their ACM keywords appended to the already exisiting object, rather than creating
                      a new one.</p>
                    <img src="assets/img/implementation/matching/code/supervisor_parse.png" alt="">
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Finding All Possible Matches</strong>
                    <p>The next process is to find all possible students matched to each supervisor. These matches are
                      found based on whether the supervisor and student share an common ACM keyword in their responses.
                      If a student is found to match to a supervisor, the student's response object is inserted into an
                      array
                      of 'matched students' for the supervisor. This also contains the ACM keyword that they matched on,
                      and the priority that the student assigned to it.
                      This process is repeated for all students for all supervisors.</p>
                    <p>Below is the actual code for finding matches. It simply loops through each parsed supervisor
                      response object (formed in the previous step) and calls the findMatchingStudents function.
                      The findMatchingStudents function then loops through each parsed student response object and sees
                      if the response contains an ACM keyword that is also present in the current supervisor resposne
                      object.
                      If so, the student object is added to the supervisors list of matched students, as described
                      above.
                      The list of matches to that sueprvisor is returned.
                      This is repeated for every supervisor.
                    </p>

                    <p>Then, for each supervisor, the matches are ordered based on the priority that the student assigned to the ACM keyword that they matched with the supervisor on.</p>

                <h5><i>1:N, N:1, and N:N Relationships</i></h5>
                In PowerApps, a N:1 relationship is called a Lookup. A 1:N relationship is simply a reversed Lookup (lookup from the
                other table into this one). Creating either of these will create a column in the table that holds the lookup, and you
                must give this column a name. N:N relationships are not tied to a column the same way and one does not need to be
                created to create an N:N relationship. A “hidden” table is created to enable an N:N relationship. This table cannot be
                accessed through Dynamics – it can only be queried using FetchXML in XRMToolBox. If you require the data that would be
                stored in this table please reference the Issues, Workarounds, and Ideal Solution section. Detailed instructions on
                creating relationships can be found
                <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/data-platform/data-platform-entity-lookup">here</a>.
                <br><br><h5><i>Subgrids</i></h5>
                Subgrids can be used to relate records in a N:N relationship. 2 subgrids are used on the Supervisor Application
                (advanced) form to receive input about the user’s Research Groups and ACM Keywords. Subgrids can be used on advanced
                forms but not on the first tab, if the form has multiple steps. Instructions on adding and configuring a subgrid can be
                found
