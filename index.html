          Abstract
        </h3>
      </header>
      <p>Universities around the world have the annual task of allocating each of their final-year students a
        supervisor. Many of these universities, including UCL, still sift through large spreadsheets manually looking
        for matches between students and supervisors. UCL also did not have a standardized way to facilitate
        communication between prospective supervisors and students. </p>
      <p>We partnered with Microsoft to showcase how a problem like this one could be elegantly solved using their
        Dynamics 365 products. We built two web apps, one for the students and supervisors to interact with, and one
        with higher privileges for the administrator to oversee the process. We brought every stage of the project
        allocation process to one site: academics register to supervise students, students browse through these options
        to reach out to supervisors, students who haven't find a supervisor apply to be automatically allocated one, and
        matches are made based on common interests. Whereas these stages used to all happen through different mediums,
        everything has been brought to a single portal. </p>
      <p>We maintained close correspondence with the lead of our own Final Year Project module to get feedback on our
        progress and update our course of action. As someone who would be using our solution, his positive feedback and
        approval of our solution was convincing confirmation that we had produced a good outcome. </p>

                <p>UCL’s Computer Science department has recently been transitioning several day-to-day activities in
                  the form of business transformation as workflows. In partnership with Microsoft, several tools and
                  systems have been requested across the teaching and learning domains. </p>
                <p>The highest burden faced by our client, Dean Mohamedally, is the Final Year Project Supervisor
                  Allocation process which is being done manually. This involves finding a supervisor who would be good
                  a match for each of 160 students in the class, which is a time-consuming process. </p>

              <div class="accordion-body">
                <p>The current solution is not fit for purpose and involves multiple stages of spreadsheets, conflicting
                  requests, and lack of timelines. </p>
                <p>The process should allow a first-round survey to all final year students, to state their degree
                  level, and whether they intend to do research only, industry only, or don’t know as their profile
                  option. </p>
                <p>Visibility of projects is a key ask for the academics - this includes research projects listing, ACM
                  classification keywords of the academics, and visibility of the industry projects lists once they are
                  ready. A solution that enables staff workloads to be input is needed at this point as those academics
                  that have capacity to supervise and are not taken by students for their research projects, should then
                  automatically make themselves available for projects with industry. </p>
                <p>The second-round survey is the matching of the students to the research projects. This needs
                  timeframes to be set up that mark key dates: when projects are advertised, when the projects are taken
                  by a student, or if a student is in discussions with an academic for a project. Only once this is
                  facilitated, it will be then signed off as allocated as FYP for Research Academic Projects. </p>
                <p>After that stage, or in parallel, for students that have said yes to wanting industry projects on the
                  UCL IXN, they will fill in a separate second round survey, called the UCL Motivation Tracking Survey.
                  This data then profiles capabilities and allows a Teaching and Learning member of the team to import
                  the student grades for the IXN and Strategic Alliance Teams to begin sourcing appropriate projects in
                  those quantities. </p>
                <p>By March this data is completed and those who said they did not know will be once again advertised to
                  come forward to choose in a 3rd cycle of survey forms. </p>
                <p>Academics need a listing that enables them to see, at a glance, who they are supervising as final
                  year projects are allocated. </p>

                  appropriate to ask open interview questions to really understand what the users want. </p>

                        <strong>When you went through the process of finding a supervisor for your Final Year Project,

                              list of supervisors – it turned out it was on the systems engineering Moodle page. </p>

                          <li>
                            <p>I had a difficult time reading through the list of available supervisor options. A code
                              was used to list their ACM keywords, so I had to look up the code every time. I wish it
                              was easier to browse the list of supervisors. Also, my device had a glitch with the file
                              that listed all the ACM keywords, which made browsing more difficult. </p>

                              supervisors. Despite the fact it was a bit long, I don’t have trouble with it. I have
                              found some great students to supervise this way. The only issues I've ever had were with
                              students who were allocated to me by the administrator, because sometimes we had little in
                              common and I felt I couldn’t provide the best advice on their dissertations.</p>

                        <strong>What have been the greatest pain points in administrating this process?</strong>
                        <p>It can take a lot of time to read through students’ answers and the available staff and try
                          to match them such that everyone is happy. There are a lot of dimensions to consider, so this
                          can be quite a taxing task. There are also some students who don’t find a supervisor on their
                          own and then don’t fill the form in, so I have to chase them down. Sometimes there are also
                          students and academics who agreed to work together but didn’t tell us, and this causes
                          confusion and a lot of back and forth. On top of all of this, I need to orchestrate the entire
                          process, from preparing forms, to getting that data out in a readable format, to making sure
                          students and staff are on board and well informed. It’s generally a lot of work. </p>
                        <strong>What are you most looking forward to getting out of this project?</strong>
                        <p>I am excited to not have to spend as much time organizing each step and doing everything by
                          hand. It took a very long time to come up with a document for students' supervisor options. I
                          had to create a list, too, for them to see the ACM keywords. It took a very long time. If the
                          system can handle displaying the correct inputs and outputs of data for each staff and
                          student, that would already cut down on a big task. The automatic matching is very useful too
                          - I could free up time to spend it better dealing with outliers or special cases. I also think
                          this could be replicated and used in many other situations and potentially by other
                          institutions to solve similar problems. </p>
                        <strong>What functionalities do you see as essential?</strong>
                        <p>I want it to be possible for professors to agree with students to work together before doing
                          any automatic matching. Please also make sure the administrator knows of all such pairs made.
                          I want to use ACM keywords to implement the matches. Academics should be asked to select their
                          ACM keywords, and I also want it to be possible for students to select some ACM keywords they
                          want to be matched by. This is particularly for students interested in research. A page where
                          the students can just type a link and see all the available supervisor options would be great.

                        every recurring event. For example, an Academic who tends to
                        supervise a similar project each year should be able to easily
                        resubmit their form submission from the previous year.

                One crude way to build a solution for our project may be to code
                it using a combination of HTML, Javascript, and CSS, whilst using
                an SQL database. However, this would be time consuming for such
                a complication project specification.
                <br><br>
                Luckily, a much easier and cleaner option was open to us. Our
                client for the project was Microsoft. As such, our project was
                particularly suited to using Microsoft products to increase the
                speed of our development.
                <br><br>
                After researching Microsoft development products, we decided to
                research Microsoft Power Apps. To do so, we both read through the
                <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/">official
                  documentation</a>, and discussed this service at length with our
                clients representing Microsoft (Lee Stott, Ayca Bas), and a
                consultant representing the Ashton Court Group (Chris Seely), who
                acted as a mentor for us during this project.
                <br><br>
                Following these discussions and our research, it was determined that
                we would use the Microsoft Power Platform to develop our project.
                The reasons for this are as follows:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Dataverse Integration</strong> [1]
                    <br>
                    The Dataverse acts as a centralised location to store tables of
                    data. It is also designed to be integrated into Power Apps projects;
                    one may directly access the Dataverse through Power Apps. Data
                    may be easily retrieved, modified, deleted, or created, in the Dataverse
                    from Power Apps using <a href="#implementation">cloud flows</a>.
                    <br><br>
                    Through cloud flows, developers can also automate several interactions
                    with the data relevant to a certain project. This is useful for
                    many purposes within our project. For instance, within our project
                    it is expected that we may display a page of information about
                    supervisors to students. Using cloud flows, this page may be
                    updated whenever there is a new response.
                    <br><br>
                    Therefore, we predicted that the seamless integration between the Dataverse
                    and Power Apps would prove useful throughout our project, as almost
                    all of the requirements of our project concern the manipulation of data.
                  </li>
                  <br>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Rapid Code Deployment</strong> [2]
                    <br>
                    One of the primary purposes of using Power Apps is for rapid
                    project development. Time would largely be the limiting factor
                    of the development of this project. Power Apps lends itself to
                    this purpose - if required, one can deploy a website with zero
                    code. While we will use code to perform more advanced functions,
                    using Power Apps we were able to create a host a website
                    <i>immediately</i>.
                    <br><br>
                    For instance, the Power Apps Canvas may be used to create
                    components quickly without needing to write any html, Power Automate
                    may be used to perform logical processes to data, and website
                    organisation is already set up, allowing one to tweak website
                    settings or structure at will.
                  </li>
                  <br>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Multiple Platform Types</strong> [2]
                    <br>
                    For our app, we have three main user types, as detailed in the
                    requirements section. Each of these user types have different
                    needs and access levels. Within Power Apps, there are several
                    types of platform a developer may create, each with different
                    capabilities and use cases. Of these, there are three platforms
                    which may be suited to our project - <i>Canvas Apps, Portals, and
                      Model-Driven Apps.</i>
                    <br><br>
                    <u>Canvas Apps</u> [3]
                    <br>
                    A Canvas App is useful for creating a very simple space for
                    a user to view and interact with data. Canvas Apps are incredibly
                    quick to create - for instance, within a few clicks and zero lines
                    of code one may create a Canvas App to display a table imported from a
                    CSV file stored in the cloud. The drawback of a Canvas App is its
                    simplicity - a developer is not afforded much customisation, and fewer
                    opportunities are present for complex interaction between a users and the data.
                    <br><br>
                    <u>Portals</u> [4]
                    <br>
                    A Portal, like a Canvas App, allows a developer to create a
                    space for users to view and interact with data. However, a
                    Portal is useful for giving a user for complex ways to interact
                    with said data. For example, a developer has greater control over
                    the view and layout of a deployment, or for instance can enable
                    a developer to create more advanced forms for the user to fill out.
                    In a Portal, a user still remains somewhat limited in what they have
                    access to - a user is not naturally given permission and an easy way
                    to interact with data. Therefore, a Portal is great for a middle-ground,
                    when a user will need to make more complex interactions with the project,
                    but only requires limited access to the database and needs a straightforward
                    layout to perform a few specific procedures without being swamped with a
                    complicated page of information.
                    <br><br>
                    <u>Model-Driven Apps</u> [6]
                    <br>
                    A Model-Driven App affords the user with a high degree of visibility and
                    control over tables in the database. Through a PowerBI dashboard [7],
                    they may also see more complicated insights in the data, visualised. The
                    drawback to this is that a user may not always <i>need</i> such close interaction
                    with the database. Additionally, there is limited room to control the user
                    interface of a Model-Driven App - it has fewer options to be as attractive
                    and simple as a Portal or Canvas App. Therefore, it is suited to a situation
                    where the user needs a high degree of interaction with a large portion of the
                    database, and will be have some pre-requisite knowledge of how to navigate and
                    use it.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <br>
                To reflect on our user types; Firstly, we have an administrator who needs a large
                amount of control over the data stored in the solution and can be easily
                familiarised with the project. Secondly, students and professors - who need a
                high amount of controlled interaction with the data, but will not necessarily
                all be familiar with how to use the project.
                <br><br>
                As a result, it appears the
                appropriate platforms to build our project with would be a model-driven app for
                the administrator, and a portal for the students and academics.
                <br><br>

                <strong>Project Operations</strong> [5]
                <br>
                A Power Apps solution may be extended using
                Project Operations. As described in Microsoft
                Official Documentation, Project Operations can be used for "easy
                resource workload distribution" and "skillset matching to meet
                demands" [5]. This fits our requirements well, as we need to
                match the skillsets of students and academics as closely as
                possible to find the optimal project for both. This would eliminate
                the need to manually develop a matching algorithms ourselves -
                development would be significantly sped up as Project Operations would
                generate this algorithms for us
                <br><br>
                There are, however, drawbacks to using Project Operations. These are:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Limited Control</strong> - while a built in allocation
                    algorithm would speep up development, naturally there would be
                    a more limited amount of control in its implementation. For
                    instance, micro-parameters may not be available for a developer
                    to tweak, and a developer is not give so much control of the
                    algorithms itself which is used in allocation.
                  </li>
                  <br>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Licence Fees</strong> - to use Project Operations, one
                    must pay a licence fee in addition to the Power Apps fee [8].
                    For a basic plan, this is £90.50 per user. If the matching
                    algorithm can be coded by hand, the amount of money saved would
                    be immense in the long run - especially when considering there
                    would likely be several users to pay for.
                  </li>
                  <br>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Longevity</strong> - linked to the above point on limited control,
                    using Project Operations makes the matching algorithm entirely tied to and
                    reliant on Project Operations. The world of technology moves quickly, and
                    it is not unlikely that at some point in the future, Project Operations
                    could become obselete, or be changed in a way which affects our project.
                  </li>
                  <br>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Project Specialisation</strong> - using an out-of-the-box algorithm
                    from Project Operations makes it more difficult to specialise and
                    optimise this algorithm to suit our project. For example, it is difficult
                    to specify if we would want to use an algorithm which prioritises the quality
                    of matches compared to one which prioritises making sure each academic has
                    at least one match.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Reproducibility</strong> - the Project Operations allocation algorithm
                    is reproducible in the sense that it is straightforward, and so the process for
                    using it in two different projects is simple. However, for projects with more
                    nuances, the stripped-down interaction with the algorithm means one will
                    struggle to apply more complicated aspects to similar projects. For instance,
                    take an example of a similar project such as allocating teaching assistants to
                    modules. If an allocation algorithm were manually coded, one could read the previous
                    for help, or code it in a more general way which allows the algorithm to be applied to
                    a range of things whilst maintaining the ability to cater to nuances. If Project
                    Operations is used, a developer would simply need to build the solution from
                    square one again, and may again struggle to deal with specific issues within a
                    particular project.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                As a result of this analysis, we decided that it would be more beneficial
                to code the matching algorithm manually - our project is fairly specialised
                and so would suffer under the contraints of Project Operations using a general
                skills-based allocation algorithm with limited control. Secondly, given the
                number of users interacting with our project, the cost may become extremely
                high. Lastly, there are many situations within UCL where an automated allocation
                algorithm would be of great help. It would therefore be of great benefit to have a
                coded allocation algorithm which may be applied in a similar way to many projects.

              <div class="accordion-body">
                Before we started development of the project, we produced some sketches of how our UI may appear, and then evaluated these to eliminate
                any weaknesses before creating more advanced wireframe prototypes.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Please note:</strong> in the early stages of our development, our client requested a project with the aim of creating a tool to
                solve the allocation of <strong>Teaching Assistants to Modules</strong>, before changing to <strong>Students to Supervisors</strong>. This
                should explain why the sketches appear to be oriented to this goal rather than our current project, however the underlying principles behind
                both projects are extremenly similar, and so we believe there was still adequate insight gained from evaluating these sketches.
                <br><br>
                <h4>
                  Teaching Assistant (Equivalent to Student)
                </h4>
                The goals for these sketches were to allow prospective teaching assistants (with our new project the equivalent would be Students) to:
                <ol>
                  <li>Be able to input the information required by UCL</li>
                  <li>View details of a class they have been allocated to</li>
                  <li>View possible classes with available spaces which they may apply for</li>
                </ol>
                The portal is split into several different pages to perform these distinct functions to prevent from overwhelming the user.
                The design was also loosely based off traditional Microsoft styling in order to give it a sense of familiarity and ease of use.
                <br><br>
                We also included checklists and notifications to help a user track the progress of their application and avoid missing a deadline.
                The form to fill out information also includes a few different input types to best suit each data point, such as a text box to list skills.
                This is comparable to the current project, as users will fill out forms in an almost indentical way in both projects and so similar principles
                can be used.
                <div style="margin: 20px; border: solid black 5px">
                  <div style="width: 50%; float: left;">
                    <img src="assets/img/ui-design/sketch-1.png">
                  </div>
                  <div style="margin-left: 50%;">
                    <img src="assets/img/ui-design/sketch-2.png">
                  </div>
                </div>
                <br><br>
                This sketch is a great start; it clearly displays all the relevant data to the student in a centralised place, and maintains a high degree of
                freedom for them as they may move freely around the app. The features of this sketch are intuitive and memorable, so do well to keep the process
                as simple as possible for the user.
                <br><br>
                
                <h4>
                  Module Lead (Equivalent to Supervisor)
                </h4>
                As a Module Lead, the needs of this project would be:
                <ol>
                  <li>Input information about the module they lead</li>
                  <li>Monitor requests to teach a module from prospective Teaching Assisstants</li>
                </ol>
                <div style="margin: 20px; border: solid black 5px">
                  <img src="assets/img/ui-design/sketch-3.png">
                </div>
                Again, there are several pages to this sketch to perform these functions. Like with the Teaching Assistants, a professor would be able
                to view their progress of an application easily and view all relevant information in a centralised place. These sketches solve an issue
                similar to that of our final project, and so we still gained from being able to sketch and analyse these designs.
                <br><br>
                While these sketches are a good start, there are certainly places of improvement. For one,
                this design hides the progress of filling out the information form from the user, which may lead to them becoming more impatient as a result. Furthermore, the user is not
                able to move freely around different stages of filling out the information form due to the sequential nature of this sketch structure, and
                so may be hindered if they wanted to check or amend a previous answer.

                Following on from our sketches and their weaknesses, we created more complicated prototypes using this feeback to create an easy-to-use UI design.
                Once again, please note that at the time of designing these prototypes, our project aims set by our clients were not the same as they are now, as explained in the section above, 'Sketches'.
                <br><br>

                <h4>
                  Teaching Assistant (Equivalent to Student)
                </h4>
                Below are the prototypes we created for a Teaching Assistant according to our previously stated UI goals:
                <div style="margin: 20px; border: solid black 5px; width: 40%;">
                  <img src="assets/img/ui-design/wireframe-1.png" style="border-bottom: solid black 5px; width: 100%;">
                  <img src="assets/img/ui-design/wireframe-2.png" style="border-bottom: solid black 5px; width: 100%;">
                  <img src="assets/img/ui-design/wireframe-3.png" style="border-bottom: solid black 5px; width: 100%;">
                  <img src="assets/img/ui-design/wireframe-4.png"  style="width: 100%;">
                </div>
                As the feedback from the sketches was largely positive, these prototypes are for the most part realisations of the Teaching Assistant sketches.
                <br><br>

                <h4>
                  Module Lead (Equivalent to Supervisor)
                </h4>
                Below are the prototypes we created for a Module Lead according to our previously stated goals, and taking into account feeback given on the sketches following discussions with our client.
                <div style="margin: 20px; border: solid black 5px; width: 40%;">
                  <img src="assets/img/ui-design/wireframe-5.png" style="border-bottom: solid black 5px; width: 100%;">
                  <img src="assets/img/ui-design/wireframe-6.png" style="border-bottom: solid black 5px; width: 100%;">
                  <img src="assets/img/ui-design/wireframe-7.png" style="border-bottom: solid black 5px; width: 100%;">
                  <img src="assets/img/ui-design/wireframe-8.png"  style="border-bottom: solid black 5px; width: 100%;">
                  <img src="assets/img/ui-design/wireframe-9.png"  style="width: 100%;">
                </div>
                For these prototypes, we tried to iron out weaknesses discovered in our sketches. For instance, the structure of filling out an information form was entirely changed, from one where the user must enter
                information sequentially to one where they may move freely between section of the form as they please. This means they may edit and check information from different
                sections of the form at will, and can easily see their progress through the process, which helps prevent a user from becoming frustrated or bored whilst
                filling out lots of information.

                <h4>
                  Evaluation
                </h4>
                Following these prototypes, we decided to use Nielsens's 10 Usability Heuristics [CITE***] in order to evaluate
                our design, because this is a well-known and renowned method of discovering issues within a design. We surveyed some
                potential users of the project, and these are the main weaknesses they identified:

                Since making these sketches and prototypes, our project aims have been changed by our client. However, the new project aims are fairly similar
                to the previous aims explored in our earlier UI experimentation. Despite the change in project goals, we tried to draw as much as we could from the
                our past ideas, and so in our final design many of the elements from the earlier headings of the UI Design section still features many of these
                lessons. Below are some screenshots of the final look of our project from the perspective of a student:
                <div style="margin: 20px; border: solid #1bb1dc 5px; width: 60%;">
                  <img src="assets/img/ui-design/fd-1.png" style="border-bottom: solid #1bb1dc 5px; width: 100%;">
                  <img src="assets/img/ui-design/fd-4.png" style="border-bottom: solid #1bb1dc 5px; width: 100%;">
                  <img src="assets/img/ui-design/fd-2.png" style="border-bottom: solid #1bb1dc 5px; width: 100%;">

                </div>
                <strong>Pictures 1&2 - View Supervisors Page</strong><br>
                Whilst they are now located along the top of the page, tabs to allow for easy and fast navigation between different pages of the portal
                remain. We tried to preserve our feedback from potential users by grouping related pieces of data closely in one space. For instance,
                on a single dedicated page a student may pan through a clear list of potential Supervisors. Clicking on a particular supervisor will take
                the user to a more detailed page, which can be seen in the second picture.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Pictures 3&4 - View Application Page</strong><br>
                Once they have filled out a form, a student may view all the data inputted into the form all in one place. Additionally, they may
                edit these fields and click 'submit' at the bottom of the page. This means that all the information a student has submitted can
                be viewed easily in one place. Again, this page is always easily reached through tabs along the top of the page.
                <br><br>
                In addition to acting on past feedback from sketches and prototypes, we made some changes to the general aesthetic and structure
                of the page. For example, in the prototypes the tabs were found along the left-hand side of the page; in the final design, they sit
                along the top. This way not entirely intentional, but simply a product of the way Microsoft Powerapps, our chosen development
                platform, works easily. We did not deem this to be a UI violation, and so we were happy to make this change. A second example of
                a change in our final design is the aesthetic. In our sketches and prototypes, we tried to use a colour scheme and layout to make
                the design resemble a traditional microsoft application. However, we instead changed the colour scheme and layout slightly such
                that it now resembles a UCL service more closely. We did this because our expected users were specified to be UCL students for the
                time being, and so we wanted to make the project as familiar to our audience as possible.
